          <desc>The game is viewed in a top-down perspective and is vertical scrolling. The player does not select plays for either offense or defense. On offense, the player simply receives the ball upon the snap and either attempt to run with the quarterback, toss the ball to one of two running backs, or throw the ball to the one long distance receiver - basically the option offense. On defense, the player chooses one of two players to control, and the computer manipulates the others. The ball can also be punted or a field goal can be attempted.</desc>

          <desc>Casino Kid is a video game on the NES platform released in 1989. It was published and developed by Sofel.  In Japan, it was released as 100 Man Dollar Kid: Maboroshi no Teiou Hen.  The game takes place in the fictional town of Lost Wages (a pun on the real city of Las Vegas, Nevada) where the object is to earn lots of money and to defeat the evil King of the Casino.  Games at the casino include blackjack and five-card draw poker.  In the Japanese version, it was possible to travel to other casinos like New York City and Japan for a substantial airfare cost.</desc>

He has become a scientist and has developed a powerful medicine together with his friend Troy. But an unknown fiend breaks into his laboratory, kills Troy, and steals the invention. It&#39;s time to recall the good old days and to embark on a quest for revenge!&#xA;&#xA;Despite the US title, the game has little to do with the Street Fighter or the Final Fight games. This is an action platformer in which the player navigates Ken around, trying to avoid or kill the enemies by shooting at them with ranged weapons, adjusting the direction of the shot, or kicking and punching them. Ken is very agile and can jump high and climb walls.</desc>

          <desc>3-D WorldRunner features many elements that are typical of a forward-scrolling rail shooter game, where the player focuses on destroying or dodging onscreen enemies against a scrolling background. 3-D WorldRunner incorporates a distinct third-person view, where the camera angle is positioned behind the main character.&#xA;&#xA;As WorldRunner, players make their way through eight worlds, battling hostile alien creatures and leaping over bottomless canyons. Each world is divided into different quadrants, and the player must pass through each quadrant before the time counter on the bottom of the game screen reaches zero. In each quadrant, the player can find pillar-like columns that house power-ups, objects that are beneficial or add extra abilities to the game character. At the end of each world&#39;s last quadrant is a serpent-like creature which must be defeated to advance. A status bar at the bottom of the screen displays the player&#39;s score, the time counter, the world number, the world quadrant, the number of bonus stars (items that increase the player&#39;s score count) collected by the player, and the number of lives, or continues, remaining.</desc>

          <desc>Zombie Nation is a side-scrolling shooter in which the player can control Namakubi&#39;s movement across the screen and the ability to shoot. The hero&#39;s designation as a &#34;great head of the samurai&#34; is to be taken literally: Namakubi is indeed a giant disembodied head. His main weapon is the ability to shoot projectiles from his eyes and bombs from his mouth which he fires at various enemies, objects and buildings. Furthermore, should a zombie hostage fall out a window he can rescue them to slowly power up his attacks. Enemies reduce health by varying amounts; health can be restored by increasing the player&#39;s score. The game features four distinct stages with two difficulty settings.</desc>

          <desc>Pool of Radiance takes place in the Forgotten Realms fantasy world. The main setting is the city of Phlan, located on the northern shore of the Moonsea, situated between Zhentil Keep and Melvaunt. The party begins in the civilized section of &#34;New Phlan&#34; that is governed by a council. This portion of the city hosts businesses, including shopkeepers who sell holy items for each temple&#39;s worshipers, a jewelry shop, and retailers who provide arms and armor. A party can also contract with the clerk of the city council for various commissions; proclamations fastened to the halls within City Hall offer bits of information to aid the party. These coded clues can be deciphered by using the Adventurer&#39;s Journal, included with the game.</desc>

          <desc>The gameplay and the design haven&#39;t much changed since Adventure Island II.  There is a world map, you can choose items before starting a level, the levels themselves are quite short (unlike Adventure Island, where each large level contained several stages).  You perform standard &#34;adventure island&#34; activities: ride various types of dinosaurs, throw boomerangs at snails, birds, snakes and skulls, collect grapes and apples, jump over stones and, of course, ride your old trusty skateboard.</desc>

          <desc>Castlevania III abandons the adventure game elements of its immediate predecessor and returns to the platform game roots of the first Castlevania title. Unlike Castlevania, however, Castlevania III is not strictly linear: Trevor, the main character, can be assisted by one of three possible assistant characters, and after completing the first level, and at several other points throughout the game, the player is given a choice of paths to follow. The choices made by the player in these circumstances can have a profound impact on how the game unfolds. There are 15 stages in total.</desc>

As Amagon, you begin the game with only a machine gun and a limited amount of ammo to protect yourself from the inhabitants of the island. Gameplay is an arcade style platform game with six levels, each with a variety of creatures and a large boss at the end. When you destroy an enemy, a power up will sometimes be left behind. Collecting these can give you extra points, an extra life, more ammo, or a mega key. If you have enough points and collect a mega key, you then have the ability to transform into Megagon. In this form, you are larger in size, can jump further, and have increased strength. You start the transformation with an amount of mega points; each time a creature injures you, points are lost. When all of the mega points are gone you will transform back into your normal size.</desc>

          <desc>The player must earn money in order to become the wealthiest gambler in the world. The game, set in New York City, is considered a spin-off from the Pachio-kun franchise. Al Capone has a cameo role in this game even though he lived about one thousand miles to the west (Chicago) in real life.&#xA;Roads, taxis and automobiles are not portrayed in the game. However, a black limousine that escorts the player from the air force base to the final casino is portrayed as driving on grass. This is in direct opposition to the real New York City where the majority of the surface is concrete (either as roads, parking lots, or as foundations for the buildings). Only parks and some older residential districts use grass in their design in the real world. Buildings are either shown as dilapidated tenements, shiny towers, or as flashy casinos.&#xA;An English language translation was made in 2007 by a ROM hacker who goes by the nickname of &#34;Pale Dim.&#34; Using the game&#39;s upper case letters that resemble the Joystix font, the English translation allows players in English-speaking countries to better understand the game. One of the changes made was to change the explosion sound from the Japanese Bom to the English Boom.</desc>

This zany, unpredictable, totally wacked-out video board game begins with a giant connect-the-dots puzzle. Suddenly, a video pencil starts connecting the dots and, before you know it, you&#39;re in a maddening race against the clock, trying to solve the puzzle. Is it an Igloo? A Penguin? Whatever it is, you - and all your friends - will have a great time trying to guess what the pencil is drawing. Guess right and you&#39;ll get a crack at the really tough puzzles - no dots or clues, just the pencil drawing a picture. Think you&#39;re up to it? Then challenge your friends. Or take on the computer. Either way, this off-the-floor board game will challenge you, excite you and generally drive you crazy for years to come.</desc>

          <name>Aoki Ookami to Shiroki Mejika - Genghis Khan (Japan)</name>
          <desc>Become Genghis Khan and lead the most fearsome army in the known world. Use your Land of Mongols to build an empire on the bodies of your enemies and the rubble of their conquered cities. With skill, cunning, diplomacy and luck, all of Europe and Asia could be yours. Failure means shame in the eyes of your princess, or even death! Victory on the battlefield requires bold strategy and clever planning. Outmaneuver your opponent with cavalry, lay siege to his castle with archers or even challenge him to a duel. But success also requires brilliant political tactics and a sharp eye for business during times of peace. Genghis Khan is based on actual history and offers a blend of strategy and role playing elements. Make history as you play the great Khan himself or his rivals, Richard the Lionhearted, Emperor Alexious III, or Shogun Minamoto of Japan.</desc>

You can either train your players (one, two, or three players at a time), play a single match, or participate in an Australian tournament, choosing one team and leading it to victory.</desc>

          <name>B-Wings (Japan)</name>
          <desc>Battle Wings, known in Japan either as B-Wing, is a vertically scrolling shooter first released as an arcade game by Data East in 1984. The game was ported by Data East to the Family Computer in 1986, and was Data East&#39;s very first home release for this platform.&#xA;&#xA;The game consists of 45 levels (30 in the Family Computer version), and no background story or plot is given. The player controls a ship called the FX-1, and collects power-up parts (called a &#34;wing&#34;) to progress through the levels and ultimately defeat the Gobunasu armored mobile fortress in the final level. The game consists of two different top-view screen levels, where the player can press the second button to descend to the ground whenever they do not have a power-up. The player is unaffected by attacks from airborne units while they are playing on the ground level, but the ship is automatically brought back into the air after a certain period of time. The player can still be hit by attacks from ground units while they are on the ground level, and can also lose their ship by crashing into obstacles. The 8-way joystick controls the player&#39;s movements, and one button is used for shooting, and the other is used for descending to the ground (or un-equipping wings). The background image continues infinitely when the player scrolls in the horizontal directions.&#xA;&#xA;Completing the final level of the game causes the score counter to increase to 9,999,999 points, which the player can enter as their high score. The player can also score cheap points by equipping and un-equipping their power-up. Pressing the button twice while the un-equipping animation is occurring cause the player to gain 2,000 points. The player gains an extra life every 40,000 points, so it is possible to gain lives almost infinitely. If the player gains over 10,000,000 points in this way before completing the final level, the counter takes over 20 minutes to increase to 99,999,999 points.</desc>

Little did he realize that while he&#39;s enjoying this adventurous journey into the unknown, there are many dangers awaiting him! Your job is to use your Zapper to protect Baby Boomer and help him find his way home to his mother. Unlike other Zapper games, you can shoot just about anything you see in Baby Boomer. Some things give extra points, while others give extra lives, open secret passages, control something in another part of the world or clear a safe route for Baby Boomer to follow.</desc>

          <name>Back to the Future (USA)</name>
          <desc>In the single mode game, the player controls Marty McFly through various stages set in 1955 in which he collects various clock icons in order to advance to the next level, and avoid the gradual vanishing of his future (indicated by a fading photograph at the bottom of the screen). If the photograph fades fully, Marty would lose a life as it would show him vanishing. Collecting 100 clocks restored the photograph to its full, unfaded status. Two power-ups can help improve Marty&#39;s control: bowling balls that can destroy enemies and a skateboard which can speed up gameplay. There are also three minigames at the end of each stage, featuring such scenarios as Marty repelling Biff Tannen&#39;s gang of bullies from a cafe, blocking all the kisses Lorraine sends Marty (in the shape of little hearts), and having to position his guitar properly to stay in tune at the dance in order for George and Lorraine to kiss. The gameplay on these stages is often compared to that of Paperboy.</desc>

          <desc>When Doc takes Marty to the year 2015 to prevent his future son from committing a crime, old Biff takes the Gray&#39;s Sports Almanac and travels back to 1955 and gives the book to his younger self. Over the next three decades, young Biff uses the information to win money on the outcome of each sporting event he bets on, making him the richest and most powerful man in the world by 1985A. To ensure that no one else gets their hands on the almanac, Biff travels through time and collects various items and puts them behind locked doors in three different periods. This action has caused a disruption in time, and now the Space Time Continuum is falling apart. With Hill Valley in ruins, Marty must now travel to all three periods, then find and return all the items back to their original places in order to retrieve the almanac and destroy it.</desc>

Check your score card to see how you&#39;re doing. The card tells you the distance in yards and par for each hole. The computer gives you a bird&#39;s-eye view and cross-sectional view of each hole, as well as close-ups of the green. You select the right club for each shot. Control your shot to get the power, distance, and hook or slice you want on the ball. After you&#39;ve made your shot the computer tells you what kind of lie you have as well as the remaining distance to the hole.</desc>

          <desc>The game is a military strategy game, like most of Koei&#39;s games, but instead of conquering a country, the goal is to depose the despotic ruler of China. You start out lowly, and have to work your way up by conquering smaller prefectures, forming alliances, and fighting small battles. You have to earn the right to attack Gao Qiu&#39;s home prefecture, though- he is off limits until you are powerful.</desc>

          <desc>Baseball Stars 2 is a 2-player baseball arcade game released by SNK in 1992 for the Neo-Geo console.  A less cartoony console version was released for the NES by Romstar the same year.  Baseball Stars 2 for the Nintendo Entertainment System was distributed by Romstar in 1992.  Changes made from the original Baseball Stars, released by SNK in 1989: Female players are no longer included in any form.  Two additional batting stances. These additional stances are never used for players on custom teams. They will only appear on the pre-made teams&#39; players.  Enhanced pitch control.  Ability to shift field formations when playing defense.  Ability to view your team roster and ratings while in-game.  Sidearm-style pitchers are never generated on custom teams. They can only be hired.  Easier bunting controls; bunts are now retractable. (Hold Down+A to bunt instead of stopping the swing partway through.)  Ability to see lead-offs while pitching/batting.  Six pitchers and four bench players instead of five each.  New music and home run animations. These include the &#34;Power connect&#34; graphic for a two-run home run, an animated graphic of the batter rounding the bases and pumping his fist for a 3-run home run or grand slam, and a similar (yet very rare) graphic including a Yorkshire terrier following the batter for a come-from-behind (usually game-ending) home run in a dramatic situation.  Can no longer name custom teams or rename players on custom teams.  You can still upgrade player using the same 15-point system introduced in the original Baseball Stars. However, the random points you get to disperse to various skills each time you purchase a player upgrade changed from between 1 and 6 to between 1 and 5.  Player upgrades overall are much more expensive while the money received during play has remained about the same. This makes it much more time-consuming to upgrade players to maximum.  You can still fire players and hire players. However, due to the fact you cannot change the names of hired players your hired player will always be named generic names given by the game (examples &#39;STAR 5&#39;, &#39;ROOK 2&#39;, etc.). This can also lead to multiple players sharing the same name throughout the custom teams, even conceivably multiple players on the same team with the same name.  Players can still create leagues of up to 125 games (6 teams playing each other 25 times) and view statistics such as League Standings and Top 10 in Average, Home Runs, Runs Batted In, Earned Run Average, Wins and Saves. (A peculiar glitch occurs when viewing league leaders. The last pitcher listed on any user-created team in &#34;View Team&#34; does not appear in any of the Top 10 leaderboards.)</desc>

          <desc>Bases Loaded 4 was Jaleco&#39;s last 8-bit entry in the long-running baseball series. The game featured slightly more elaborate animations than its predecessor, and much larger fielders. Removed was the goal to play a flawless game; instead the game featured more traditional modes, including exhibition games and full season play.&#xA;&#xA;Geared more toward faced-paced arcade gameplay than simulation, Bases Loaded 4 was not licensed by Major League Baseball or the Major League Baseball Players&#39; Association. Therefore, it did not feature real American (or Japanese, for that matter) teams or players.</desc>

          <desc>Battle Chess is a video game version of chess in which the chess pieces come to life and battle one another when capturing.  It was originally developed and released by Interplay Entertainment for the Amiga in 1988 and subsequently on many other systems, including 3DO, Acorn Archimedes, Amiga CD32, Amiga CDTV, Apple IIGS, Apple IIe, Atari ST, Commodore 64, DOS, FM Towns, NES, Mac OS, PC-98, Sharp X68000 and Windows 3.x.  In 1991, Battle Chess Enhanced was released by Interplay for the PC, featuring improved VGA graphics and a symphonic musical score that played off of the CD-ROM.  Battle Chess was critically acclaimed and commercially successful, resulting in two official follow-ups as well as several inspired games.  Its remake, Battle Chess: Game of Kings, was released on Steam (software) on March 16, 2014.</desc>

          <desc>The Super Spy Hunter has a super spy car. It&#39;s actually a well-armed car that can turn into a boat or a plane at opportune times. The action is fast vertical scrolling as the vehicle faces all manner of powerful vehicle threats from a well-funded terrorist enemy -- cars, trucks, helicopters, etc. Luckily, there are many powerups to collect along the way, both defensive and offensive.</desc>

          <desc>Battle City is a multi-directional shooter video game for the Nintendo Family Computer produced and published in 1985 by Namco. The game was later released for the Game Boy and was included in the Japanese version of Star Fox: Assault. It is a port of the arcade game Tank Battalion with additional features (including two player simultaneous play, and an edit feature, both explained later). There was also a rendition for Nintendo&#39;s Vs. System arcade cabinets.&#xA;The player, controlling a tank, must destroy enemy tanks in each level, which enter the playfield from the top of the screen. The enemy tanks attempt to destroy the player&#39;s base (represented on the map as a bird, eagle or Phoenix), as well as the human tank itself. A level is completed when the player destroys all 20 enemy Tanks, but the game ends if the player&#39;s base is destroyed or the player loses all available lives.</desc>

There are traps and enemies added for each level, from ants, grasshoppers, and even dragonflies and &#34;venus flytraps&#34; in the later levels. The player must find and collect from many flowers scattered all over the sidescrolling level and return to the hive after three flowers are visited to add honey to the jar. The level is complete when the jar is full, in the case of levels 3-12, this requires every flower to be visited.</desc>

Along the way, Big Nose collects bones, that he can use to buy items from the various shops that include spells, upgrades to his abilities and items.&#xA;This game is also very difficult because you cannot restart from where you left off once all your lives are gone. It is also very long with four islands (Paradise Island, Monster Island, Terror Island, and Chaos Island) each containing several levels. Big Nose the Caveman dies in a single hit unless he has stones. The stones can shoot out of his club, killing enemies. As many as three stones can come out of the club. There are also many pitfalls, traps and deadly lava/water since Big Nose can&#39;t swim.&#xA;It was followed by a sequel in 1992.</desc>

          <desc>Bigfoot was a racing game released in July 1990 for the Nintendo Entertainment System.  It was developed by Beam Software and published by Acclaim.  The game was advertised by the legendary monster truck of the same name in the cartoon segment of the 1990 television show Video Power, titled The Power Team.  The show also often used sound effects for the actions of not only Bigfoot, but others as well.  The gameplay involves racing monster trucks including the title truck, Bigfoot (blue). The computer controlled trucks are green (The Growler) and yellow (The Charger) if the computer&#39;s truck runs out of money and cannot repair their rig.  It was not uncommon for a skilled player to be challenged by three to four different monster trucks during the game.  In two player mode the 2nd player&#39;s truck is red.  The object of the game is to advance to the next level (race) with incurring the least amount of damage as possible.  The levels consist of car crushing, mud bog, tractor pull, hill climb and the later levels are a combination of everything except the sled pull, simply called a drag race.  To advance to the next event the player must complete a &#34;cross country&#34; race collecting money, points, etc. without damaging the truck.</desc>

          <desc>Theodore &#34;Todd&#34; Thornley IV has had enough. After being humiliated once again by his rival, Jeff &#34;Crash&#34; Cooney and his blue-collar buddies from Southside High School at the All-City Track Meet, he has decided to issue a challenge to Crash. Inviting two of the other elite high schools to participate in the challenge, plus an additional team sponsored by his wealthy father, Todd has seemingly stacked the deck against Crash and his boys. The game has four different teams to choose from, as well as a fifth computer-controlled team. Each team have five members each with their own strengths and weaknesses, making some better suited to certain events than others. Before each event, players have the opportunity to go shopping in the mall to buy power-ups for their characters. These items are paid for through the various medals that each team achieve as they progress through the challenge, but since the winner of the challenge is the team that collects the most medals overall, players must be fairly judicious in how much they spend. There are two types of events in the game: individual events (Hammer Throw and Roof Top Jumping) and head-to-head events (400 Meter Hurdles, Swimming and Fighting). In individual events, each team takes turn individually and ranking is determined by who gets the most points. The head-to-head events take place under a single elimination tournament format, in which one player against another in a series of heats. The player who successfully defeats both of his opponents will get to compete against a member of Team Thornley for first place. The game can be played by up to four players. Since there&#39;s never more than two teams competing at the same time, the third and fourth player can play simply by alternating between the two controllers. Thus, a four player adapter is not required, unlike other Kunio-kun games.</desc>

          <desc>Bill &amp; Ted&#39;s Excellent Video Game Adventure is an action-adventure video game that is part of the Bill &amp; Ted franchise and is based on the film Bill &amp; Ted&#39;s Excellent Adventure that was released in North America by LJN for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1991.  The game&#39;s plot is not an adaptation of the movie, but rather serves as an original continuation to the film&#39;s events.  The story begins when Rufus summons Bill S. Preston Esq. and &#34;Ted&#34; Theodore Logan for a mission.  Both boys arrive at different times; first Ted then Bill.  They are informed that time-space rebels have gone back in time, kidnapping various historical figures and leaving them stranded in different time periods.  So now they must travel to the time periods, retrieve these figures and return them to their correct time periods.  This must be done as soon as possible; for if history isn&#39;t made right, the boys will miss the big concert that will launch Wyld Stallyns&#39; music career.  Unfortunately, Rufus can only loan out a pay phonebooth for this trip.  Once the mission is explained, Ted leaves and Bill arrives later.  Rufus states that since they both came alone, it&#39;s best that they work separately.  From there Bill is brought up to speed on the situation.  Bill is instructed to go back in time and leave items to help Ted along the way in each time period he visits.  When Bill has done this he will start his own search.  Ted will also do the same for Bill&#39;s search after he has found a historical figure.</desc>

          <desc>Bill Elliott&#39;s NASCAR Challenge is a simulation of the NASCAR Winston Cup circuit, and thus operates like a racing game.  The gameplay action was always through an in-car perspective.  Players could chose to run single races at each track or run for the season championship.  The race distance was chosen by the player, which ranged from 10 miles to the realistic distance of 500 miles for the superspeedway races.  In the MS-DOS version, the championship consisted of a visit to each of the eight tracks.  In the NES and Game Boy versions, the season championship consisted of each of the four tracks run twice, for a total of eight races.  Championship points were awarded consistent to the real-life Winston Cup of the time.  Both the MS-DOS and Nintendo versions allowed the player to setup the car, with effects to be seen.  Both of those versions also allowed the player to choose whether they would race with the effect of damage on their car or not.  However, a large enough collision with another racecar on the track always would result in the player going out of the race in an out-of-control crash.</desc>

          <desc>Binary Land is a puzzle video game developed by Hudson Soft in 1983 for the MSX, FM-7, NEC PC-6001, NEC PC-8801, and in 1985 for the Famicom. The MSX version saw release in Japan by Kuma Computers Ltd in 1984.&#xA;&#xA;While the Famicom version has a grand total of 99 levels; there is no ending screen implemented in the game.&#xA;&#xA;In the Famicom version of the game, players have to unite two penguins, Gurin (male) and Malon (female), who are in love. The MSX version features a human boy and a human girl; gameplay remains identical to the Famicom version. Players control Malon and Gurin simultaneously; with a timer adding to the difficulty. These penguins move in mirror images of each other. The game features many different stages. After completing the 17th stage, players have to start over again on stage 1. &#34;Je te veux&#34; by Erik Satie is the background music in the game during the levels. Upon uniting the two penguins, Beethoven&#39;s &#34;Ode to Joy&#34; is played.&#xA;&#xA;A top-down view is utilized in the game; similar to the method used in The Adventures of Lolo. Standing in their way are spiders, birds and other creatures which the player must attack with the penguins&#39; spray. Cobwebs occupy some of the cells on the playing field; possibly slowing the player down long enough for a spider to kill either Gurin or Malon. With each level arranged on a 10-by-15 grid and a vertical wall separating the two penguins from each other, only the upper central cell is free for both characters to reach. This &#34;free cell&#34; always holds the caged heart that is required to complete the level. A row of walls surrounding each player in a maze-like environment. In order to make the challenges more difficult; they are unbalanced and offer a different experience for Gurin and Malon.</desc>

          <desc>The player controls a fisherman who is competing in a tournament.  The objective in each round of the tournament is to catch the largest billfish.  These fish include blue marlin, black marlin, striped marlin, swordfish and sailfish.  Other fish that can be caught include dorado, barracuda, tuna and sharks.  As the player fights fish, there may be several events that occur that the player must respond to, such as a smoking reel or a marlin attempting to tangle the line in the propeller.  Other events are static, such as the fish biting off the line or the fish becoming exhausted.  Each of these events changes the dynamics of the fight, such as changing how much line the fish has or how tired the fish is.  There are three attributes that the player can increase as they fight more and more fish.  These are Muscle Power (ability to pull in heavier fish), Body Strength (ability to fight a fish longer) and Skill (ability to respond to events properly).  The Blue Marlin features a password system to save the player&#39;s progress.  A password is generated at the end of every tournament round, and after the tournament is completed (with the player victorious). If the player uses this password to begin a new tournament, they can start over with all of their attributes from their previous game.</desc>

          <desc>Shadow of the Ninja can be played by up to two players simultaneously, with one player controlling Hayate (the male ninja) and the other as Kaede (the female ninja). In either mode, the player can decide which character they want to control before the game actually begins. There are no actual performance differences between either character.&#xA;The player character can run, crouch, climb ladders, attack, and jump like in most side-scrolling action games as well as hang onto an overhang and move under it. If the player has more than half of their vitality remaining, they can perform a special attack by holding a button for an extended period, summononing a thunderstorm that will damage all on-screen enemies, but at the cost of roughly half of their maximum vitality.&#xA;The player&#39;s default weapon is a katana, which can be traded for a kusarigama and vice-versa. The kusarigama has a longer range than the katana and can be swung upwards diagonally and horizontally. However, the kusarigama can only damage enemies from a specific distance and does not work as well at close range like the katana. If the player picks up a weapon they already have, its attack power will be strengthen by an increment of one level (with up to three attack levels). However, if the player takes too much damage, their weapon&#39;s strength will be reduced back to its previous level. There is also the possibility to use both weapons, if the player starts with the kusarigama and collects secret powerups hidden in some levels (for example in the central wheel of level 1.3). The player can also obtain shurikens and hand grenades as well, both which can only be used as long the player&#39;s supply lasts before the player reverts back to using the katana or kusarigama. All four weapons are obtained by destroying item boxes scattered throughout each stage, along with vitality potions. Something worth mentioning is the fact that the potions being offered in order to heal yourself if played by 2 players will have different colors, which depending if the color of the potion is the same as the character that use it, it will replenish a large amount of health but if the color of the potion is not the same it will heal less.&#xA;The game consists of five stages, with the first four stages being divided into three segments and the final stage into two. The player will fight numerous types of enemy characters throughout each stage, including bosses and sub-bosses. once a boss has been defeated it will explode, this explosion will heal players the closer they are from it, since actually the same amount of health from one stage will be carried to the next one until either recovered with potions or by dying. The game ends if the player loses all of their vitality and only five chances are provided to continue. If two players are playing the game, their continues will be shared.</desc>

          <desc>It is based on Bo Jackson&#39;s baseball career.  An option allows the player to play anywhere from five to nine innings.  Nintendo Power gave this game a 2.8 out of 5 in their September 1991 review while Electronic Gaming Monthly issued a 4.25 out of 10 review in their October 1991 issue of their magazine.  Players can either play in exhibition mode or playoff mode. Either one or two players can participate.  In addition to those options, a CPU vs CPU mode and a CPU vs CPU quick mode are available in order to quicken up a tournament; the purpose is to see the stats of that particular match and quickly end tournaments.  The game uses city names but not the team names because of not having any proper licensing with Major League Baseball.  However, the players are purely fictional and they cannot be edited.  Some of the player names are parodies of real life baseball players (such as Baltimore&#39;s &#34;Kenrip&#34; being a not-so-subtle parody of Cal Ripken).  There is even a cheat code that allows players to play as an all-Bo Jackson baseball team.</desc>

          <desc>A Bomberman named White Bomberman is framed for terrible crimes by Black Bomberman. After being accused of robbing a bank, White Bomberman is thrown in jail. Bomberman&#39;s mission is to escape his prison cell and bring Black Bomberman to justice.&#xA;&#xA;The game follows the classic Bomberman formula: you are in a room full of blocks and enemies and Bomberman must plant bombs to destroy the blocks and enemies.

          <name>Bonk&#39;s Adventure (USA)</name>
          <desc>The game&#39;s protagonist is Bonk, a strong caveboy who battles anthropomorphic dinosaurs and other prehistoric themed enemies.  Bonk&#39;s mission is to rescue Princess Za (a small pink Pleisiosaur-type reptile) who has been kidnapped by the evil King Drool (a large, green Tyrannosaurus-type dinosaur).  In the Arcade version, Bonk is also assisted by a female version of himself.  Bonk attacks enemies by &#34;bonking&#34; them with his large, invincible forehead.  Bonk starts the game with three hearts&#39; worth of health, which are depleted to blue as Bonk takes damage and three extra lives.  Bonk&#39;s health can be restored in increments by collecting fruits and vegetables.  Bonk can also collect pieces of meat as power-ups; these lend him special abilities and make him stronger.  There are three stages of power-up: his normal self, a second stage during which he can stun enemies by pounding on the ground and a third stage where he becomes temporarily invulnerable.  Meat can be found in two varieties: big meat and small meat.  The effects of meat are additive but wear off over time.  A small meat gives Bonk the second stage of meat power but will eventually decay into the first stage of meat power, and then back into regular Bonk.  Eating a small meat while in stage two will put Bonk into the third, invincible stage of meat power.  And eating either size of meat while in the third stage of meat power-up will reset the timer on Bonk&#39;s meat power.  Bonk can occasionally collect red heart power-ups that refill an entire heart worth of health, or even more rarely, a large red heart which restores all of Bonk&#39;s missing health.  There are also two rare, blue heart power-ups in the game which will increase Bonk&#39;s maximum health by one heart.  Bonking an enemy will typically knock it backward and slightly into the air.  Defeating an enemy yields points and also releases a small &#34;smiley&#34; power-up.  Bonk&#39;s smileys are totaled at the end of each stage after defeating the boss of that stage.  The player is given additional points and a caveman type congratulation based on how many smileys were collected.</desc>

          <desc>In the game, each player controls one of the two Bubble Dragons, Bub and Bob. The player can move along platforms, as well as jump to those above and to the side, similar to most platform games.&#xA;The player can also blow bubbles. These can trap enemies, who are defeated if the bubble is then burst by the player&#39;s spiny back. Bubbles that contain enemies can be popped at the same time resulting in different foods being projected throughout the level. Each enemy trapped in a bubble equates to a different food. Food is consumed and transferred to points (an increasing scale of 1000 points is awarded for each enemy burst in tandem with another meaning: one enemy burst equals one food item worth 1000 points, two enemies burst equals two food items worth 1000 and 2000 points, three enemies burst equals three food items worth 1000, 2000, and 3000 points, and so on) which results in more lives. These same bubbles also float for a time before bursting, and can be jumped on, allowing access to otherwise inaccessible areas. Players progress to the next level once all enemies on the current level are defeated.&#xA;Enemies turn &#34;angry&#34;  becoming pink-colored and moving faster  if they are the last enemy remaining, escape from a bubble after being left too long, or a certain amount of time has been spent on the current level. A monster will also become angry if either player collects a skull (the only negative item in the game), and the monster is hit by the resulting comet crossing the screen. However, this is a rare occurrence.&#xA;After a further time limit expires, an additional invincible enemy appears for each player, actively chasing them using only vertical and horizontal movements. These do not need to be defeated to complete the level, and disappear once a player&#39;s life is lost.&#xA;Contact with enemies and their projectiles (rocks, lasers, fireballs, etc.) is deadly, resulting in the loss of a life.&#xA;The game&#39;s music was written by Japanese team Zuntata. Peter Clarke, Tim Follin and David Whittaker have arranged music for home computer ports (some versions have a new intro music by Whittaker).</desc>

The setting for Burai Fighter, according to the manual, is to fend off seven bases of Burai, super-intelligent cyborgs.  The player starts out with a relatively weak cannon but can upgrade to ring, laser and missile weapons, which are much more powerful.  The player can also choose from three difficulty settings: Eagle, Albatross and Ace, but the fourth difficulty setting, Ultimate, must be unlocked.  One proceeds by controlling the character in 8 directions and can shoot in a different direction from the direction he is looking.</desc>

          <desc>The player assumes the role of an unnamed commando trying to destroy several enemy military bases. The player&#39;s character is seen from behind and initially starts behind a protective wall (the wall can get damaged and shattered by enemy fire). The player must use a limitless ammunition gun and a limited number of grenades to fend off enemy troops and damage the base. An enemy gauge at the bottom of the screen depletes as foes are destroyed and certain structures (usually the ones that collapse when destroyed, rather than simply shattering) are brought down. At the successful completion of a level by fully depleting the enemy gauge, all the remaining buildings onscreen collapse and the player progresses to the next stage. Boss fights, however, start from the beginning if a player dies. (A feature criticised by many players. It can be circumvented, however, if two players play simultaneously and at least one stays alive at a given moment.)&#xA;Power-ups appear from time to time, being released from objects destroyed onscreen. Some power-ups give special weapons: One of them is an extremely fast machinegun and other one is an automatic shotgun with a slightly lower firing rate, but has a larger crosshair, allowing it to strike a wider area with each shot. Others grant extra grenades or additional points.&#xA;Two players could play this game, cooperatively, simultaneously.&#xA;The arcade cabinet is a standard upright. Each player uses a trackball to move the player from side to side, and move the crosshairs about the screen. On later board revisions, a joystick was installed instead with an optional sub-pcb for use with a trackball. With a trackball, rolling (an invincible movement during which the player could not attack) is done by pushing the trackball to maximum speed.</desc>

          <desc>Cancelled.&#xA;&#xA;In the single-player side-scrolling action game the player controls a California Raisin through five stages in an effort to rescue the band and their band&#39;s musical notes that were stolen by the gang of jealous musicians. The player walk, jump, climb on vines, moonwalk (by pressing the &#34;select&#34; button) and shoot an unlimited supply of grape jelly beans as projectiles. As was the case with other Capcom games, such as Mega Man and DuckTales, one can play the first four levels in any order that you want, but the final level is only available after you have collected the musical notes from each of the four levels.&#xA;The first four levels include The Grape Vine, The Factory, The Maize Maze and The Juicery. The final level takes places in The Clouds. During each level you can collect &#39;I&#39; icons that give you temporary invincibility, regular black musical notes for bonus points, &#39;Sunshine&#39; icons to restore your health, and &#39;Raisinette&#39; icons to give an extra life to the player. One can also locate items by shooting at the thin air or at columns.</desc>

Each character can fight hand-to-hand, throw select items on the ground and launch either projectile weapons (Captain America&#39;s shield and Hawkeye&#39;s arrows) or energy beams (Iron Man and Vision).

          <desc>This game is a port of the original Arcade version and was released exclusively in Japan.&#xA;This version features several substantial differences from the Arcade version. The player now has a health gauge and can take more than one hit before losing a life (which can be replenished by picking up hearts). However, some of the enemy grunts now take more than one slice to defeat as well. The player can now purchase all weapon power-ups in item shops, which can be changed through a sub-menu. The stages are different and the bosses include new foes such as Frankenstein&#39;s monster and a giant octopus. The player can enter houses and rooms where an old lady will offer advice to the player (such as an enemy&#39;s weak point). However, some of the old ladies the player will encounter are hostile and will bring a curse to the player (like reducing his health by half). The ending varies depending on whether the player used a continue to finish the game.</desc>

          <desc>Casino Kid is a video game on the NES platform released in 1989. It was published and developed by Sofel.  In Japan, it was released as 100 Man Dollar Kid: Maboroshi no Teiou Hen.  The game takes place in the fictional town of Lost Wages (a pun on the real city of Las Vegas, Nevada) where the object is to earn lots of money and to defeat the evil King of the Casino.  Games at the casino include blackjack and five-card draw poker.

          <desc>Castelian is a platform game with some distinctive unique features.  The player character, a small green creature called Pogo, is on a mission to destroy eight towers that have been built onto the sea by planting bombs at the towers&#39; peaks.  Pogo&#39;s progress is hindered by enemies and obstacles which he has to avoid in order to reach the top of the tower.  The actual game play happens at each tower in turn.  Pogo starts from the bottom and has to find his way up to the top.  The towers are cylinder-shaped and have ledges on their outside, either horizontal, forming stairs or connected by elevators.  Because of the cylindrical shape, the towers have no &#34;left&#34; or &#34;right&#34; edges, instead allowing Pogo to walk all around the tower.</desc>

          <desc>Castle of Deceit is a sidescrolling game for the NES where the player takes control of a wizard trapped in the titular castle with only one spell to defend himself.  The game was often considered frustrating for its length and lack of a save or password system.  Phfax, a mystic being and wielder of the Emerald Magic, consented to offer his life to protect the stones of Rune.  For centuries he dwelled within the plasma of energies of the stones where the Runes were hidden.  Until at last it drove him insane.  Such was the power of the stone that even the bitter hallucinations of his madness were given life.  Six deadly beings appeared stealing the Rune Stones.  You, Cebo, the most promising of the young Magicians of Dace, must enter the castle, exploring the realities. But do not trust your senses - what you see, what you hear may all be a lie!</desc>

After defeating a boss at the end of the second level, they switch to the next Cheetahman for the following two levels as in the Action 52 version.  Due to a bug, it is impossible to get to the levels in which one plays Cheetahman Aries without altering the ROM image or experiencing a glitch that very rarely starts the game on these two levels.  Cheetahmen II is famous for its music and for its lack of quality in all other areas.  Like Action 52, it was not licensed by Nintendo.</desc>

          <name>Chevaliers du Zodiaque, Les - La Legende d&#39;Or (France)</name>
          <desc>Saint Seiya: Ougon Densetsu is an RPG based around the anime and manga series known as Saint Seiya. It was developed and published by Bandai in 1987 for the Famicom.&#xA;&#xA;The story of the game draws heavily from the first story arc of the series, from the beginning of the story to the fight with the Gold Saints. The game remains faithful to the original story while introducing some original elements. When the game came out, the story line was in the middle of the Gold Saints story arc. As a result, the last boss of the game is an original character. The actual final fight of the Gold Saints arc was carried over into this game&#39;s sequel, Saint Seiya: Ougon Densetsu Kanketsu Hen.&#xA;&#xA;The gameplay mixes side scrolling action scenes to transport the character from place to place where he may have to jump over obstacles and fight basic enemies, with a turn based combat system against bosses and other significant battles. In order to be successful at these turn based battles, the player must distribute his power, or Cosmos, to various attributes before each attack. Failure to do so typically results in no damage dealt to the opponent, and a lot of damage received. When Life is lost, the main character can be revived, but if all Cosmos is lost, then the game is over.</desc>

          <desc>The main character in the game is a female driver, Clarice, of a Honda City (the North American version features a male driver) on a tour of all the sights and roads across the world. To prove that she has visited a particular location, she must drive around the location painting every section of the road white. However, the police, who have no tolerance for vandalism, attempt to stop the driver from completing her goal. The player&#39;s car can jump and fire cans of oil. To avoid forcing the player from retracing the same roads again, the roads change color when the car drives over them, indicating that that specific road has been painted. There are three main obstacles: police, cats and spikes. The police chase after the car and if a police car comes into contact with the main character&#39;s car, the car &#34;explodes&#34; by turning into a group of hearts and the player loses a life. To combat this, the player can obtain cans of oil, which can be used to cause the police cars to spin out of control, allowing the player to bump them off the screen. Other enemies include a cat, which, when hit, causes the player to lose an extra life as the cat goes diagonally off the screen (but does not cause the car to &#34;explode&#34;) with playing of a comical music, &#34;Der Flohwalzer&#34;, known as &#34;Neko Funjatta&#34; (I Stepped on the Cat) in Japan. There is also spikes, which make the car &#34;explode&#34; on contact. Occasionally, a balloon may float by during any given stage. If the car touches one of these balloons, it collects it and collecting three such balloons will activate a warp that sends the car multiple stages ahead and provides significant bonus points. Although the city you travel to will change, the difficulty pattern of the road will remain the same. As the number of cities you travel to loop endlessly, the game is not shortened by taking a warp. One particular thing about this game is the &#34;catchy&#34; tune that plays in the background as you enter a new city. Although it uses &#34;ethnic&#34; variations according to the destination, it&#39;s an adaptation of a famous classic piece, &#34;Allegro non troppo e molto maestoso&#34;, from Tchaikovsky&#39;s Piano Concerto No.1.</desc>

          <desc>Concentration was a popular game show in the mid-to-late 1980s and this game was adapted from that television program. Two players can play against each other, or one person can play against a computer generated opponent. The answer to the puzzle is hidden by tiles. The tiles have words denoting game prizes (&#34;Mexico&#34;, &#34;Camera&#34;, &#34;Telescope&#34;, for example) and your object is to find the two matching worded tiles. Exposing two at a time, your memory is taxed as more prize tiles are revealed and then covered over again. As more tiles are matched, the hidden puzzle is revealed. Solve the puzzle and you win the game.</desc>

          <desc>There are 25 stages in the game, including bonus stages. Each series of five generally contains one of each type of mission. The fifth are generally the boss stages. The bosses are a sea serpent (as seen on the cover), a giant crab, a giant squid, a red and black version of the sea serpent and a giant shark. The game uses a powerup bar similar to the Gradius series. Powerup pods are collected to move the selector to different powerup items. When the desired powerup is highlighted, the player can select it, after which the menu returns to an unhighlighted state. Menu options are &#34;Turbo&#34; (increase the speed of the boat), &#34;Fire&#34; (increase the number of bullets the primary gun fires), &#34;Speed&#34; (increase speed of shots and rate of fire), &#34;Missile&#34; (improves missiles) and &#34;Force&#34; (a force field around the boat plus replenished health). The speed boat used for game play starts with a single gun which can be upgraded to a quadruple spread shot. Missiles can also be added to the boat&#39;s arsenal and can be upgraded to heat-seekers. Between stages which are not connected by water, the Cobra Class has a helicopter style propeller that extends from the roof of the cabin. However, this flying state of the boat is never used in gameplay. The boat has a 12-point damage bar which can be reduced by contact with obstacles or enemy fire.</desc>

          <name>Cocoron (Japan)</name>
          <desc>Cocoron is a side scrolling platform game developed by Takeru. Tapir, an enigmatic blue wizard in spotted pajamas from the Dream World, sends the player on a quest to rescue princess Rua. But things quickly become more complicated and the player soon has to rescue other characters along the way, such as Santa Claus, the king of Trump castle and the blue fairy Cocoron. Tapir can manipulate people&#39;s dreams and this ability gives Cocoron an unique twist - the player can assemble his own character by combining one of the eight available heads to one of the eight available bodies (which both include several designs to choose from, resulting in literally hundreds of combinations! ). More than a mere physical appearance, each part also defines the character&#39;s attributes, such as his health, speed, how high he can jump and so forth. As a rule of thumb, heavier characters are slower than light ones, but have more health and resistance. There is also a list of eight different weapons to choose from (from boomerang to shurikens, umbrellas and music notes). They all come with different attack patterns and strength - some shoot straight whereas others fire along an arc or explode on contact. They can also be powered up, and collecting five power icons (symbolized by the weapon in use) upgrades the weapon to the next level (up to a maximum of five times). Colored eggs are scattered around each stage or left behind by defeated enemies - cracking them open release all kind of items, such as health, extra lives, weapon power-ups and colored orbs. The latter trigger special events - some power up the active weapon for a short amount of time, whereas others allow the player to control slides, grant him invincibility or refill his health bar. Cocoron features a world map and is divided into five different areas - the player is free to play them in any order and, interestingly, stages change in function of the sections he travels through. Finally, up to six different characters can be created and stored, and returning to the house at the center of the map allows to switch between them.  --VideoGameDen.com</desc>

          <desc>Commandos Burn, Smith, Beans and Iron are a special forces team who have seen more than their fair share of action. Neo City is their post, now that a terrorist group known as D.N.M.E. is bombarding its citizens with a typhoon of a crime wave. The C-Force has been asked to stop them, no matter what. Take command solo or team up with a comrade in 2-player mode. Even if you go it alone, you can call on a backup soldier for spot support. Tap into your special forces training to devise unique battle plans and attack patterns, select weapons, and decide which soldier&#39;s individual strengths are best suited for the dirty deeds going down. You can switch commandos whenever the situation calls for it. Endure all 5 grueling missions, swarming with traps and terrorists, that take place in a warehouse, on a battleship, at a construction site, aboard a helicopter, and at C-Force headquarters. Encounter secret passageways, hidden rooms, aerial angle views and more. Every man is a walking arsenal with heavy-duty weaponry including rocket launchers, flame throwers, bazookas, rifles, land mines and time bombs. This mission is no cakewalk, but if it was, they wouldn&#39;t have given it to you. Hit it with all you&#39;ve got!</desc>

It was released only in Japan. The game received a sequel in 1997, with Paro Wars, which is the Parodius equivalent of this game.&#xA;&#xA;The object of Cosmic Wars is to utilize an army composed of Gradius characters (Vic Vipers, and Big Cores) and battle enemies in various star systems. The player can be either the Bacterion Empire or the forces of Gradius. There are many different unit types, ranging from small fighters to large capital ships.</desc>

          <desc>Star Voyager&#39;s gameplay requires the player to venture through various sectors of the galaxy in search of different alien fleets so they can be defeated. Fuel stations are placed around sporadically and help if fuel is running low. There are several different planets that are either empty or have people that can upgrade the player&#39;s equipment to fight off the enemy fleets. These upgrades include the super laser, improved shields, and engines that enhance the ship&#39;s warping ability. Warping is a vital part of the gameplay. If players do not warp to different sectors wisely, they might end up lost, run into dangerous sectors such as the black hole or the asteroid field, or run out of fuel. The game ends if enemy ships destroy the CosmoStation Noah.</desc>

As the game continues, the player character can use different powers - some ranged - to take out enemies and progress further. Eventually, the player will have the option of becoming a metal-armored officer with considerably more fire-power, though this power-up state will vanish if too much damage is taken. The player character will also level-up after destroying so many enemies, improving their health and &#34;cosmo points&#34; - a stat similar to mana that is used to power the player character&#39;s special attacks.&#xA;&#xA;The game&#39;s world is a network of caves that the player can explore for necessary items and bonus areas. The NES version expands this aspect, providing some Metroidvania-esque exploration. Some impediments are in place to restrict further exploration until the right item is found, as well.</desc>

          <desc>Crackout is a video game that was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System by Konami in 1991. It is based upon Atari&#39;s Breakout games of the 1970s. The object of the game is to clear levels by either destroying all bricks or defeating the enemies.&#xA;There are four zones of eleven levels each. The zones are Cubic Zone, Mirror Zone, Tube Zone and Final Zone. This game differs from the original Breakout as it contained enemies on screen that could be hit to gain power ups. Powerups included a parachute to slow the ball down, multiple balls, or projectiles. There were also level warps in the form of &#34;Konami Man&#34;, who would fly from top to bottom of the play area. There were typically 1 - 3 enemies on screen at once, appearing out of a trapdoor in the top corners, or let in through the side walls. Every few levels there was also a boss, ranging from a small dragon to a centipede. The bosses changed colour from Green to Blue to Pink, each time increasing in speed. Each level also contained a hidden letter which made up a password presented at the end of the game (Zone 4 Level 11). If this was not input correctly, the player restarted the game from the beginning. If the player input the password correctly, they were shown the end credits which consisted of a procession of the enemies from the game. The password is MERRYCHRISTMAS.</desc>

          <desc>Theodore &#34;Todd&#34; Thornley IV has had enough. After being humiliated once again by his rival, Jeff &#34;Crash&#34; Cooney and his blue-collar buddies from Southside High School at the All-City Track Meet, he has decided to issue a challenge to Crash. Inviting two of the other elite high schools to participate in the challenge, plus an additional team sponsored by his wealthy father, Todd has seemingly stacked the deck against Crash and his boys. The game has four different teams to choose from, as well as a fifth computer-controlled team. Each team have five members each with their own strengths and weaknesses, making some better suited to certain events than others. Before each event, players have the opportunity to go shopping in the mall to buy power-ups for their characters. These items are paid for through the various medals that each team achieve as they progress through the challenge, but since the winner of the challenge is the team that collects the most medals overall, players must be fairly judicious in how much they spend. There are two types of events in the game: individual events (Hammer Throw and Roof Top Jumping) and head-to-head events (400 Meter Hurdles, Swimming and Fighting). In individual events, each team takes turn individually and ranking is determined by who gets the most points. The head-to-head events take place under a single elimination tournament format, in which one player against another in a series of heats. The player who successfully defeats both of his opponents will get to compete against a member of Team Thornley for first place. The game can be played by up to four players. Since there&#39;s never more than two teams competing at the same time, the third and fourth player can play simply by alternating between the two controllers. Thus, a four player adapter is not required, unlike other Kunio-kun games.</desc>

Once your crystal quota is met, quickly locate the exit and move on to the next, more challenging mine. Crystal Mines is part action and part strategy. There is a time limit to locate the crystals in each mine, plus avoiding falling rocks and monsters will keep you on your toes, but before long you will need to figure out how to locate crystals by properly removing obstructions and navigating tricky mazes.</desc>

          <name>Cyberball (USA)</name>
          <desc>Cyberball is an Atari Games arcade game of 7-man American football, using robotic avatars of different speeds, sizes, and skill sets. The game replaced the standard downs system with an explosive ball that progresses from &#34;cool&#34; to &#34;warm&#34;, &#34;hot&#34;, and &#34;critical&#34; status as it is used. Players can only defuse the ball, resetting it from its current state back to &#34;cool&#34; by crossing the 50 yard line or by change of possession, whether through touchdown, interception or fumble. A robot holding a critical ball while being tackled is destroyed along with the ball. The robots also possess finite durability. As offensive units are tackled, they wear down, finally issuing smoke and then flames after a number of hits. A flaming robot will explode when hit, thereby fumbling the ball. Players can upgrade robots with faster and more durable units using money bonuses they earn during play. Players select from run, pass or option plays on offense, after which the computer presents four individual plays from which to choose. On defense, a player can select short, medium or long defenses, and then select a specific defensive scheme.&#xA;The standard Cyberball cabinet consists of two monitors, each with two sets of controls for a maximum of four players, but Atari Games released single player and two player versions as well.&#xA;The standard configuration allows single player, two player cooperative, two player head-to-head or four player head-to-head play. Playing with two teams of two persons opened up a new dimension of gameplay. Computer controlled avatars ran offensive patterns in very specific ways before reaching their assigned passing spots. Human players, however, could exploit the fact that a number of offensive plays started with identical formations. By choosing one play, but moving their avatars in imitation of a similar but different play, the offensive team could disguise their intentions before suddenly breaking for their assigned pass locations. This offensive flexibility forced defending players to quickly recognize plays and move to break them up by rushing to what they guessed was the intended passing spot. Most often, the timely use of the defender&#39;s turbo, a short-term speed boost usable once per play, would determine whether the play resulted in a missed pass, an interception, a long gain, or a score. This ability to improvise in four player mode built the popularity of Cyberball, leading to many tournaments across the United States for a period of time.&#xA;Cyberball was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992 by Jaleco. Tengen intended to release it unlicensed, but Jaleco purchased rights to publish it first. It has also been ported to numerous other platforms, including the Commodore Amiga, Atari Lynx and Sega Genesis.</desc>

          <desc>Dance Aerobics is a chance to get fit by following the movements of an aerobics instructor.&#xA;&#xA;Players use side B of the Power Pad accessory (a floor mat with 12 pads in a 4 by 3 grid) to follow the movements of an aerobics instructor. To succeed the player must press the pads with there feet and hands at the same time as the on screen aerobics instructor. Any missed movements are recorded on a mistake counter and 10 missed movements will fail the level. The routines (a set of repeated movements) start slow and simple with a bit of no-penalty practise time however as the player gets better the routines get more complex with less practices time. Each level has a set number of routines that increase with each level from 4 at the start to a total of 32 on the final level (level 7). At the successful completion of each level the player will get a pass stamp which they can enter later to skip that level.</desc>

          <desc>Darkman was developed by Twilight and published by Ocean Software in 1991. It was released for the ZX Spectrum, NES, Amstrad CPC and Commodore 64. It was also ported to the Game Boy and Atari ST. The game&#39;s plot is loosely based on the film of the same name. In this side-scrolling platformer, the player controls Darkman, a superhero who can jump, kick and punch, as well as swing from a rope during action sequences between levels. In each level, Darkman disguises himself as the boss of the level, whom he must defeat before the time limit elapses. Tying into the plot of the film, Darkman wears masks of various gangsters who are responsible for his disfigurement, but his disguise dissolves after being exposed to sunlight for too long. The character changes into a different member of the evil gang in each level, taking on their attack moves as well as their face. In-between levels, Darkman must photograph his quarry before he can make a mask of them. These scenes involve moving the cursor to take a picture of the gangster. The better the photo accuracy, the more time Darkman is granted to complete the subsequent level. The final level is the most faithful to the film and takes place on a skyscraper under construction. After the player defeats their mirror image five times and wipes out the mob cartel that scarred Darkman, the final boss is inexplicably a clone of Darkman himself.</desc>

          <desc>Dash Galaxy in the Alien Asylum was an action game for the Nintendo Entertainment System released in 1990 exclusively in North America. Players take the role of Dash Galaxy, a space scout who has been captured by a hostile civilization. Gameplay involves a series of floors with several rooms each. Keys must be collected to progress to higher floors and, eventually, an escape ship. Dash&#39;s only weapons are a limited supply of bombs and remote detonators. Good timing is crucial to completing the game, requiring navigation of trampoline jumps and roaming enemies. While the rooms are side-scrolling action puzzles, the floors have a  overhead view and include more difficult block-moving puzzles which can fatally trap a player.</desc>

          <desc>A Boy and His Blob: Trouble on Blobolonia is a side-scrolling platformer in which the character and his friend Blob (full name Blobert) travel together on Earth and on Blobert&#39;s home planet Blobolonia in a quest to defeat an evil emperor. Blobert can change into several different items when he is fed jelly beans. A licorice jelly bean, for instance, will change Blobert into a ladder, while a honey jelly bean will turn him into a hummingbird. Most of these transformations can be remembered mnemonically due to a correlation between the flavor of the jelly bean and the item that results. Whistling at Blobert causes him to change back, often with a musical accompaniment similar to the main theme.</desc>

          <desc>Death Race is seemingly inspired by the Sylvester Stallone movie Death Race 2000 released 15 years before this game. The object of the game is to run down innocent pedestrians in your souped-up automotive grim reaper. Progress through the race courses in 8 U.S. cities, moving from west to east starting with San Diego and Phoenix. Each race consists of capturing a flag and finding the exit door, all while squishing or gunning down as many people on foot as possible while avoiding helicopters and heat seeking missiles that are actively trying to discourage this unique hobby. If the time runs out, a barrage of missiles descends on the player&#39;s car to indicate that the race is over.&#xA;&#xA;The player has a certain amount of money to begin with and earns more money for completing the races alive. This money can be used to upgrade the engine, steering, tires, chassis, or weapon systems on the car.</desc>

Each time you are hit by enemy fire or by a Deathbot, your energy depletes. Lose all of of your energy and a life is lost. And of course, each level ends with a large boss Deathbot.

          <desc>The player&#39;s force consists of nine different types of units and one headquarters unit (which is a unit by itself and also can be used to attack). Each scenario gives a different set number of units to use, which the player can mix and match between the different typese without going over that limit. When in a one-player game, the second controller can be used to modify the CPU forces. When playing against the CPU, the computer will be given a different ratio of units to command than the player. On the easiest scenario both the player and the CPU have the same amount of units, on all others the CPU will have more than the player. There is no variance in artificial intelligence, so the only thing that makes the later maps harder is the larger number of units the CPU has. The game is turn-based with no time limit. The object of the game is to destroy the enemy&#39;s headquarters unit. The player that does so first wins. Units have different mobility range, which varies according to the unit type and (except for aircraft) the terrain. They also have different shooting range, though this is fixed and not depends of the terrain. All unit types have limited ammunition and fuel. In order to replenish them the player must land them at the appropiate buildings; for example, all aircraft must stop at an airport in order to recharge their fuel and ammo supply. A certain unit is particularly strong or weak against a particular opponent, performing average against every other unit types.</desc>

          <desc>The view of the game is from the cockpit of a spacecraft. The goal of the game is to explore a grid which is displayed on screen in search of opponents to destroy and to land on planets some of which refuel the energy and refill ammo to the player&#39;s arsenal of weapons which consist of his photon laser. This is his primary weapon while the torpedoes become his second weapon. After the player has destroyed every enemy that is on the grid, a number will be indicated. This number represents how many enemies are in that quadrant of the grid. After blasting numerous enemies, the player will finally be able to go to the planet labeled &#34;B&#34; on the grid. These planets are unlike the other planets as they do not refill the player&#39;s vehicles energy or ammo. Rather, they are an enemy base that proceeds with the player entering a 8-bit cutscene of his space craft entering the base&#39;s gravitational orbit with the game play changing from a first person cockpit you had on the grid stage to a horizntal 2D shmup stage similar to Konami&#39;s Gradius or R-Type. Using this perspective, the player can fire projectiles from the front or back of his ship.</desc>

This can be dangerous, as Tamagon can be squished by getting caught between a maze wall and the moving outer boundary. After the first maze is cleared, the next objective is to get four Bibles, and put them into a seal. The Bibles give Tamagon the same powers as with the Crosses. After carrying them all into the seal, the Devil flies to the next maze. In between, a bonus maze shows up where Tamagon collects six Bonus Boxes under a time limit. The pattern then repeats.</desc>

          <desc>Bandai released their version of Dick Tracy in August 1990. The objective is to solve several mysteries without accusing the wrong person or shooting too many unarmed villains.&#xA;Each level starts out with a case to solve, and some possible clues. The player drives Tracy&#39;s vehicle through the city, avoiding snipers and other cars, to various locations mentioned in the clues, where the action shifts to a side-scrolling adventure game. If the player goes to the right location, he will find, during the course of his side-scrolling fighting, a clue icon that provides additional clues for the case, or the player will be able to speak with a character from the comics who give clues. There is one car chase in each level. Once the player has collected enough clues, he can drive to the location where the perpetrator is and arrest him.</desc>

          <desc>There are 40 terrorists scattered throughout the building and John McClane&#39;s task is to clear each floor of terrorists and he can then use the stairwell or the express elevator to travel upwards, to a maximum of floors 31-35 (more floors are unlocked in &#34;Advanced&#34; mode). In addition, by shooting at grids in the wall, John is able to climb in the vents, dropping into a designated spot or moving down or up a floor. At the start of the game, the player character can only use a pistol (with 15 bullets) and his fists to dispose of enemies, but later acquires several weapons, such as submachine guns, explosives and flashbangs which the terrorists can also use. When McClane is shot, a few picked up items can drop where he must pick them up again. However, bullets have minimal range, only shooting straight or on a 45 degree angle. McClane&#39;s health, which is drained by bullet wounds, can be restored by collecting soda cans from either enemies, snack machines (by shooting several bullets at them) or empty rooms. The player loses the game when all life is lost. The player has about four minutes before one of the six locks are opened, but can gain more time by destroying the main computer on the fifth level. Once all the locks have been opened, the vault is opened and the game&#39;s final battle is triggered. The player has only a few minutes to go to the 30th floor, for a final confrontation with Karl, Hans and any of the 40 terrorists left alive. One interesting aspect of the game allows the player to listen to Hans shouting orders to his guards through a two-way radio. However, after the second lock is opened, Hans will tell everyone to not use the radio. Also notable is the &#34;foot meter&#34;. The meter starts out full, but will eventually decrease if the player character steps on shattered glass or runs around. If the meter becomes empty, McClane will walk much slower than he does when the foot meter is full. It can be restored by collecting med-kits. The game features cinematic sequences which change the story depending on which actions the player takes. For example, if there is fewer than one minute left and the player defeats Karl, the last scene with John and Holly will tell the player the roof has been destroyed by the helicopter sent by Hans.</desc>

          <desc>Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei is the first game of the popular Megami Tensei series of role-playing video games. It is based on the novel Digital Devil Story by Aya Nishitani. Although Atlus has published a majority of the series, the first two games were created by Atlus but published by Namco (known as Namcot at the time), after it bought the video game rights to the Japanese horror novel series by Aya Nishitani, the first named Digital Devil Story.[1] This game is a role-playing video game that features extensive dungeon crawling and focuses heavily on demons, which have gone on to become a trademark of the series.</desc>

This is the first game in the series to not be based on the original novels by Aya Nishitani, but it retains much of the gameplay aspects of its predecessor. The music in the game is enhanced by an eight-channel Namco 163 WSG sound chip on the cartridge.&#xA;&#xA;Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei II retains several gameplay aspects of the first game, including demon catching and fusing and first-person dungeons.&#xA;&#xA;There is a world map that features overhead graphics. The player controls the party through the world map and dungeons, fighting enemies in random encounters with turn-based combat. Transportation such as rail and highway that existed at the end of the 20th century does not exist; movement by foot is the most common activity in the game. There is a big hole in the ground that limits the player&#39;s explorations. Underground passage appear in the guise of former subway tracks. 3D dungeons have been adopted in this game for beginning player. However, there were many glitches and disruptions that occur under auto pilot, causing it to hang under certain conditions.&#xA;&#xA;When both the hero and his partners are dead, the game over screen consists of the underworld ferryman Charon picking up a soul.</desc>

The game play consists primarily of side-scrolling action. Dirty Harry can punch and kick the copious thugs that assault him using their own fists, guns, baseball bats, nets, and dynamite. The hero can also pull is .44 and aim it in 5 directions in order to pick off enemies, but the ammo is limited. Further, Dirty Harry has a number of other tools at his disposal, provided he collects them.</desc>

So off went Daisy to get some cherries from her cupboard and there were none to be seen! &#34;Pogie&#39;s pinched the cherries!&#34; she cried, as she saw Pogie&#39;s pawprint in the cupboard. &#34;That darned fluffle. Come here you!&#34; and Pogie promptly darted off into the enchanted forest to escape Daisy&#39;s rage. Dizzy and Daisy decided to go into the forest to catch Pogie and gather some more cherries at the same time. Whilst searching for Pogie they got lost and found a castle, where they thought they would find help, but it seemed deserted. They looked in the castle for Pogie, but Daisy caught herself on a mystic spinning wheel. She started feeling really sleepy, so she found a bed and went to sleep. &#34;Wake up Daisy, wake up!&#34; shouted Dizzy. But before he could wake her up, Rockwart the troll caught him and locked him up in an underground prison! Now Dizzy must escape, wake up Daisy from her enchanted sleep, defeat Rockwart, and find the cherries along the way.</desc>

Because Donkey Kong has plenty of coconuts to hurl at you, and those bees know just where to sting you so it hurts. But, if you keep your wits about you, you&#39;ll score lots of points and have lots of laughs in the best Donkey Kong of them all... DONKEY KONG 3!</desc>

          <desc>The game features one and two player modes, both of which are single screen. In the first mode, the objective is to enter math answers in order to receive points. These questions include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.&#xA;In the two player mode, two players control two characters as they race to create a math formula to reach the number shown by Donkey Kong, incorporating platform gameplay. The mechanics are similar to Donkey Kong Junior; players climb vines to reach higher areas in order to collect numbers scattered around the area. In order to complete mathematics problems, players must collect at least three things: the first number, the symbol necessary to reach the number shown by Donkey Kong, and the second number. When the game features a high number, such as 66, players must collect multiple numbers and mathematics symbols in order to reach this. For example, players could choose a nine, a multiplication symbol, and a seven, followed by an addition symbol and a three to reach the number 66. The two player game have two different levels, Calculate A and Calculate B. Calculate B is more challanging, not only the goal is a negative number, but giving players the set number.</desc>

          <name>Double Dare (USA)</name>
          <desc>The video game version of Double Dare played exactly like its television counterpart. Rounds one and two were 10-question trivia rounds, each of which started with a toss-up challenge. Round three  the obstacle course  featured eight stages to be completed within 60 seconds. Toss-up challenges determined which team got initial control of the trivia round. To complete a toss-up, each player had to determine the precise speed and angle of whatever object they were throwing to hit a target.  Physical challenges were played the same way. All questions were multiple choice, and each player could use the up or down arrows on the controller to make his selection. Three possible answers and either a dare, double dare, or physical challenge option were offered. The player confirmed his selection by pressing the A button. Confirming a dare doubled the base dollar value of the question; a double dare quadrupled the base dollar value. The player with the most money at the end of round two went on to the obstacle course. In order to move through an obstacle, the player had to repeatedly alternate between pressing either the left and right or up and down arrows on the controller&#39;s D-pad. In order to grab the flag, the player had to position the on-screen contestant in just the right spot and then press the A button to jump and retrieve it. Some found it easier to get through the course by using the NES Advantage, a joystick controller, rather than the NES&#39; standard controller. The obstacles are all based on real obstacles from the show (with one exception) and are randomized before a game. They include The Tank, The 1-Ton Human Hamster Wheel, The Fireman&#39;s Flagpole, The Monkey Bars, &#34;Dallas&#34;, Mount St. Double Dare, Moonwalk, and an original obstacle designed like a triangular jungle gym. &#34;Prizes&#34; for beating the obstacle course included a BMX bicycle, television set, an NES console, and several other gifts, ending with a exotic vacation -- though it can prove very difficult to get the best &#34;ending&#34; by completing the last obstacle. The obstacle course&#39;s flag colour depended on which team was playing, if blue, the flags were blue, and if red, the flags were red.</desc>

The player character has a repertoire of martial art techniques which they can perform by using the joystick and three action buttons (kick, jump, and punch) individually or in combination. Techniques ranges from basic punches and kicks, to more elaborate maneuvers like hair grabbing moves or elbow punches. When playing with another player, one can assist the other by grabbing their partner&#39;s opponent from behind. The player begins the game with a certain number of extra lives and a life gauge which depletes as the player takes hits from enemies. If the life gauge runs out or the time limit reaches zero, the player will lose a life.&#xA;There is a small variety of enemy characters that the player will face thorough the course of the game. Certain enemies will carry a melee weapon which the player can use by disarming the enemy carrying it and then retrieving the item from the floor. The available weapons includes steel bats, whips, throwing knives, and dynamite sticks, as well as large objects such as cardboard boxes, oil drums, and rocks, which the player can lift and throw at enemies or kick it towards incoming ones.&#xA;The game is divided into four different stages or &#34;missions&#34;, which consist of a city slum, a factory, the woods, and the hideout of the boss. The game normally ends if a single player defeats the final boss alone. However, if two players manage to complete the game together then the two will be forced to fight each other in order to determine who will win Marian&#39;s affections.</desc>

Armed with only a Knife in the beginning, as Michael moves through the house, he can pick up Handgun Bullets, Machine Gun Bullets, Grenades and life-replenishing Yellow Vitamins and Red Vitamins. There is a menu which has four options, open, get, go, and hit. There are 11 Warp Zones in all. At the end of each of the first 10 Warp Zones, Michael must fight a large monster that carries a piece of the Laser and guards a valuable piece of equipment, the latter consisting of the Ultra Space Sensor, four Life Bottles, the Air Helmet, the Jump Boots, two Blue Vitamins and the Shield Suit. Once Michael fully assembles the Laser, he&#39;ll be able to challenge the final boss, Canbarian.</desc>

          <desc>Dragon Ball: Daima Fukkatsu ( Doragon Bru Daima Fukkatsu?, lit. Dragon Ball: Great Demon King&#39;s Revival) was released in Japan for the Famicom on August 12, 1988 by Bandai. It takes place during the Piccolo Daimao Saga. It was one of the first games to have a board game, which included battles using cards. The battle card games are a hybrid of role playing games, board games and trading cards. The players move around a game board and encounter characters on the way. Some characters offer information and others need to be battled. The outcome of each fight is determined by the randomly generated hand of cards players and the opponent are dealt. The player flips over cards in a certain order, and their actions are shown in an animated battle that lasts until one of the characters is defeated.</desc>

          <desc>Known in Japan as Dragon Ball: Shenlong no Nazo (  Doragon Bru: Shenron no Nazo?, Riddle of Shenlong), in France as Dragon Ball: Le Secret du Dragon and in Spain only as Dragon Ball, the game was developed by Tose and released by Bandai in 1986. The game stars Goku and very roughly follows the first two volumes of the Dragon Ball manga, culminating in the first wish from Shenlong. The game consists of 2D overhead areas where Goku must fight many enemies and side scrolling sequences for the boss fights. It was added as bonus feature in the Japanese release of Dragon Ball: Origins 2 in 2010.&#xA;&#xA;    In the USA the game is known as Dragon Power. Although the Japanese, French and Spanish editions of the game used the familiar art and music from the Dragon Ball anime, the US version is stated to be based on Journey to the West with no mention of Dragon Ball.[2] Goku was changed to more closely resemble an Americanized Kung Fu stereotype, being pictured on the box with a white gi and blue headband. Master Roshi has been similarly changed to look more like a traditional martial arts master. Bulma is called &#34;Nora&#34;, Yamcha is called &#34;Lancer&#34;, Oolong is called &#34;Pudgy&#34;, Pilaf is called &#34;King Minos&#34;, the Kamehameha is the &#34;Wind Wave&#34;, and the Dragon Balls are referred to as &#34;Crystalballs&#34;. Also, the game has been shortened; all levels that correspond with the Kung-Fu Tournament halfway through the game have been removed. Furthermore, all perverted references have been censored out; for instance, the &#34;girl&#39;s panties&#34; power-up (which temporarily makes Goku run fast) now resembles a triangle-cut sandwich.&#xA;&#xA;    The European version, released in France in 1988 (and in Spain in 1992), retains the Dragon Ball license. In France, it was the first Nintendo game translated into French. However this translation includes a lot of misspellings. In Spain, the game was also released in French language, although the Spanish version specifically featured box description and instruction manual translations in Spanish language.</desc>

Multiplayer is a six player tournament using difficulty level of computer players that are in the save file. Players can choose between Goku, Gohan, Piccolo, Trunks and Vegeta. Winner records are kept in the game data, as well as any moves the player might learn.&#xA;&#xA;The game follows, Dr. Lychee, a survivor of the Tuffle race annihilated by the Saiyans. Lychee manages to escape from the planet with a ship containing Hatchhyackku, a super computer able to create &#34;Ghost images&#34; of other warriors, though he is killed soon after. Hatchhyackku creates a ghost image of him to get revenge on the surviving Saiyans. He places machines that emit a gas capable of destroying life on Earth, so Goku, Gohan, Vegeta, Future Trunks, and Piccolo rush to destroy the devices located around the planet.</desc>

          <desc>The player takes control of a magical human fighter who has the ability to transform himself into a flying dragon. As the fighter, the player can run, crouch, jump, and attack with his sword as he would in most side-scrolling action games.

As a dragon, the player will hover in the air while the screen scrolls automatically to the right, similarly to a side-scrolling shoot-&#39;em-up game. The dragon&#39;s main attack is his fire breath. While the player can fly in any of the eight directions, they cannot turn around and the dragon will only face and attack to the right. While in dragon, the player&#39;s metamorphosis gauge will gradually be drained out. The player will transform back to a fighter if the metamorphosis gauge empties out completely or when the player rapidly taps the A button again.&#xA;As the fighter, the player can also shoot a projectile attack by holding the B button until the character begins to flash. The types of projectile fired by the player depends on the color of the player&#39;s outfit, which can be changed by picking up certain power-up items labeled with the letters G (green, the player&#39;s default color), B (blue), and R (red). Changing the color of the player&#39;s outfit will also change the pattern of the dragon&#39;s fire breath attack. Other power-ups includes energy restoring potions, a flower that helps fill the metamorphosis gauge faster, and a ring that destroys all on-screen enemies. At the end of each stage, the player will receive a staff that will increase their maximum health.&#xA;There are six stages in all, each with their own guardian awaiting to challenge the warrior at the end. The game will end if the player loses all of their life power and only three chances are provided to continue at the stage where they died before the player is forced to start all over.</desc>

          <desc>Dragon Power is an action-adventure game developed and published by Bandai for the Nintendo Entertainment System on March 3, 1988. It is a heavily localized version of the Japanese game Dragon Ball: Shenron no Nazo (translated to Dragon Ball: Mystery of the Dragon God), originally released on November 27, 1986. Although some of the European releases retain the Dragon Ball assets (under the title Dragon Ball), the North American release removes most references to the franchise. The game follows the first two volumes of the Dragon Ball manga, as the young monkey-tailed boy Goku (along with his teenage friend, Bulma, known in the North American version as Nora), embark on a quest to find all seven Dragon Balls (Crystal Balls in the NA version), in which it is believed that collecting them grants the user any wish they desire. Along the way, they encounter various characters, including turtle hermit Master Roshi (Hermit in the NA version), shapeshifting anthropomorphic pig Oolong (Pudgy in the NA version) and desert bandit Yamcha (Lancer in the NA version).</desc>

          <desc>Dragon Warrior uses console role-playing game mechanics which were described by Kurt Kalata of Gamasutra as archaic in 2008. The player takes the role of a namable Hero. The Hero&#39;s name has an effect on his statistical growth over the course of the game. Battles are fought in a turn-based format and experience points and gold are awarded after every battle, allowing the Hero to level-up in ability and allows them to buy better weapons, armor, and items. Progression consists of traveling over an overworld map and through dungeons, fighting monsters encountered via random battles along the journey.</desc>

          <desc>Dragon Warrior III is noted for greatly expanding upon the original Dragon Warrior and Dragon Warrior II. The game uses basic console role-playing game conventions, such as leveling up by gaining experience points and equipping items. Battle is turn-based like the other games in the series.&#xA;Dragon Warrior III features a class system, in which each character has a certain class. While the Hero always keeps the Hero class, the other characters can choose among the following: Soldier (Warrior in the GBC version), Fighter, Pilgrim (Cleric), Wizard (Mage), Merchant (Dealer), Goof-Off (Jester), Sage, and Thief which was available only in the later versions. The choice of class greatly affects the character&#39;s stats and spells he or she can learn. Furthermore, upon reaching experience Level 20, a character has the option of changing classes at the temple of Dhama, found halfway through the game. The game starts with just the Hero in the party, who then is able to recruit a party of three at the local tavern. Unlike most Dragon Quest parties, aside from the Hero, the party is not made up of characters involved in the story. Although only four characters can be in the party at a time, extra members of the party can be kept at the tavern, allowing room for new recruits. Another innovation is an arena where the player can place bets on the outcome of monster battles.&#xA;The remakes incorporated some interface changes from later games in the series, such as simplified door opening; the bag, which replaced bank item storage; the item sorting &#34;Tidy Item&#34; and &#34;Tidy Bag&#34; commands; and the &#34;Full HP&#34; command, which can be used outside of combat to automate the process of casting healing and status restoring spells.&#xA;While the earlier Dragon Quest games were also non-linear, Dragon Quest III was the most substantial example of open-world gameplay among the early Dragon Quest games. It also allowed the player to swap characters in and out of the party at will, and another &#34;major innovation was the introduction of day/night cycles; certain items, characters, and quests are only accessible at certain times of day.&#34;</desc>

          <desc>Dragon Warrior III is noted for greatly expanding upon the original Dragon Warrior and Dragon Warrior II. The game uses basic console role-playing game conventions, such as leveling up by gaining experience points and equipping items. Battle is turn-based like the other games in the series.&#xA;Dragon Warrior III features a class system, in which each character has a certain class. While the Hero always keeps the Hero class, the other characters can choose among the following: Soldier (Warrior in the GBC version), Fighter, Pilgrim (Cleric), Wizard (Mage), Merchant (Dealer), Goof-Off (Jester), Sage, and Thief which was available only in the later versions. The choice of class greatly affects the character&#39;s stats and spells he or she can learn. Furthermore, upon reaching experience Level 20, a character has the option of changing classes at the temple of Dhama, found halfway through the game. The game starts with just the Hero in the party, who then is able to recruit a party of three at the local tavern. Unlike most Dragon Quest parties, aside from the Hero, the party is not made up of characters involved in the story. Although only four characters can be in the party at a time, extra members of the party can be kept at the tavern, allowing room for new recruits. Another innovation is an arena where the player can place bets on the outcome of monster battles.&#xA;The remakes incorporated some interface changes from later games in the series, such as simplified door opening; the bag, which replaced bank item storage; the item sorting &#34;Tidy Item&#34; and &#34;Tidy Bag&#34; commands; and the &#34;Full HP&#34; command, which can be used outside of combat to automate the process of casting healing and status restoring spells.&#xA;While the earlier Dragon Quest games were also non-linear, Dragon Quest III was the most substantial example of open-world gameplay among the early Dragon Quest games. It also allowed the player to swap characters in and out of the party at will, and another &#34;major innovation was the introduction of day/night cycles; certain items, characters, and quests are only accessible at certain times of day.&#34;</desc>

          <desc>500 years ago, the Kingdom of Granville fought a terrible war with Darces the Dark Overlord. A great hero, the warrior &#34;Magi&#34;, rose to challenge Darces. He owned six magical swords and a powerful suit of armor that was impervious to all but the most powerful of magic. Five of his six swords were Elemental blades, each created from the rarest metals on earth. The sixth blade, &#34;Tores&#34;, used an even more powerful metal. Using his powers, Magi defeated Darces, and exiled him to a far away land. After defeating Darces, Magi grew old and died. Now, on a dark, stormy night in the Kingdom of Granville, Darces the Dark Overlord returns to the land. According to an old saying, &#34;When the shadowed veil returns to mask the midday sun, the Fire of Serpents will rise again; Five shall become the One. The elements now heed his call, and hope is born alive; We will have our peace once more when One becomes the Five.&#34;</desc>

          <desc>A Bomberman named White Bomberman is framed for terrible crimes by Black Bomberman. After being accused of robbing a bank, White Bomberman is thrown in jail. Bomberman&#39;s mission is to escape his prison cell and bring Black Bomberman to justice.&#xA;&#xA;The game follows the classic Bomberman formula: you are in a room full of blocks and enemies and Bomberman must plant bombs to destroy the blocks and enemies. Several blocks contain power-ups (such as blast radius increasers or fuse shorteners), and one in each level contains a door, which takes Bomberman to the next level.&#xA;Passwords are given after game over, recording the level, number of bombs, and strength of bombs. These passwords can be entered when the game starts allowing the player to continue where he left off.&#xA;New to the series are the multi-player modes. Vs Mode is a 2-player mode, while Battle Mode is a 3-player mode. The objective is to kill the opposing Bomberman by planting bombs. An NES Four Score is required to play the 3-player mode.</desc>

          <name>Earth Bound (USA) (Proto)</name>
          <desc>Mother begins by telling the story of a young married couple from rural America who mysteriously vanished after a dark shadow covered their small country town. Two years later, the husband, George, returned as mysteriously as he vanished, and began a strange study in complete seclusion. His wife, Maria, was never heard from again.&#xA;The story then forwards to a year in the 1980&#39;s (1988 in the Japanese version), focusing on a 12 year old American boy, referred to as Ninten, whose home is attacked in a paranormal event. He possesses a striking resemblance to EarthBound&#39;s Protagonist, Ness. Instead of Ness, who has a blue and yellow striped shirt, red shoes and white socks, Ninten has a blue and yellow shirt with slightly thinner yellow stripes, and blue shoes and red socks. He is a huge fan of baseball and is a fan of penguins. His father calls him and explains how Ninten&#39;s great-grandfather studied PSI, and asks him to investigate a crisis occurring across the world. After rescuing and befriending a 7 year old girl named Pippi from the local cemetery in his hometown of Podunk, Ninten discovers the worldwide phenomenon is the work of an invading alien race. Ninten is then warped to the world of Magicant, where the land&#39;s ruler, Queen Mary, asks Ninten to find her song, the Eight Melodies, and play them to her. After returning to the real world, Ninten visits an elementary school in Merrysville and meets an 11 year old boy who is constantly teased for being a weakling, referred to as Lloyd (Loid in the English prototype). Ninten befriends Lloyd, and Lloyd joins Ninten on his adventure to find the Eight Melodies. The two then travel to the town of Snowman to deliver a lost hat to a girl with PSI power, referred to as 12 year old Ana, who tells Ninten she saw him in a dream, and joins the party in hopes of finding her missing mother.&#xA;After finding most of the Melodies, the party travels to the city of Valentine (Ellay in the English prototype), and the trio do karaoke at the Live House. Ninten is then harassed by the boss of the local Black Blood (Bla-Bla) Gang, referred to as Teddy, for attacking his gang members, and challenges him to a duel. After realizing Ninten is a formidable opponent, Teddy surrenders and joins Ninten&#39;s party in hopes of avenging his parents, who were killed at Holy Loly Mountain. Teddy replaces Lloyd in the party, who rests at the Live House. The party reaches a cottage at the base of Holy Loly Mountain (Mt. Itoi), where Teddy goes to make phone calls. Ana pulls Ninten into another room and asks him to be with her always. The two dance and confess their love to each other. Teddy enters the room, and the party begins to leave, when they&#39;re attacked by a powerful robot called R7038 a robot similar of what they encountered before in Advent Desert. The robot knocks out the entire party, but Lloyd arrives with a tank from a man they have met in Advent Desert during their travels and destroys the robot, but accidentally attacks the party as well. Teddy is critically wounded (possibly dead in the original Famicom version), and stays at the cottage to heal, while Lloyd rejoins the party.&#xA;The newly reformed trio takes a motor boat out on Holy Loly Lake, where they are pulled into a whirlpool into an underwater laboratory. There, they find a robot named Eve, who tells Ninten that she was built by George, who was taken to the ends of the universe and later returned. He built Eve with the purpose of protecting Ninten. The laboratory becomes flooded and the party is whisked back to the base of Holy Loly Mountain, where, with the aid of Eve, they climb the mountain. As the party approaches the mountain summit, another robot, R7038XX, attacks the party. Eve destroys the robot, but Eve is destroyed in the battle as well. Eve&#39;s scrapped remains sing Ninten the seventh of the Eight Melodies.&#xA;With seven of the melodies learned, Ninten and the others are warped to Magicant where Ninten sings the Eight Melodies to Queen Mary. Upon hearing the Eight Melodies, Queen Mary remembers the rest of the song. Queen Mary reminisces on how she loved an alien named Gyiyg (Giegue in the unreleased translation, and Giygas in EarthBound}}, as if he were her own child. She tells Ninten that he was always wagging his tail, except when she sang lullabies to him. Queen Mary then reveals she is George&#39;s wife, Maria, and, with her purpose complete, vanishes to return to George&#39;s side. Magicant, being only a mirage created by her conscience, vanishes with her.&#xA;The party is warped back to the top of Holy Loly Mountain, where the party discovers a strange grave. George&#39;s spirit visits the tomb and tells Ninten that his great-grandmother Maria spread her love in the form of melodies. Large rocks block the entrance to a cave inside Holy Loly Mountain, but Maria&#39;s conscious uses the last of her power to clear the entrance. Inside they discover human prisoners sealed within cylindrical tanks. One of the prisoners identifies Ana&#39;s hat and informs the party that her mother is among them, but that they must destroy the Mother Ship before attempting to rescue them.On the other side of the cave is where they encounter the Mother Ship and Gyiyg contained within a fluid-filled tank. Gyiyg expresses his gratefulness to Ninten&#39;s family, as Ninten&#39;s great-grandmother, Maria, raised him, but explained that George stole vital information from his people that could have been used to betray them, then stated that one of George&#39;s descendants, Ninten, was interfering with their plans and must be stopped. Gyiyg tells Ninten that he cannot be defeated by Ninten&#39;s &#34;meager&#34; powers, but offers to save Ninten alone if he boards the Mother Ship. Ninten declines, so Gyiyg tells Ninten to fall into a long sleep with the rest of the &#34;ugly Earth People&#34;. The party begins to sing the Eight Melodies, but Gyiyg attacks the party to quiet them. After several attempts, the party finishes the lullaby, and Gyiyg, calmed by Maria&#39;s motherly love, admits defeat, swearing he and Ninten will meet again. The Mother Ship flies off, leaving the heroes behind. In the original Famicom release, the game ended at this uncertain point, but it is extended in the English prototype and Mother 1+2 versions, and instead the party returns to the base of the mountain where the imprisoned humans are all revealed to have been freed. In the process, Ana is finally reunited with her mother. The heroes all return to their normal lives, and Teddy is revealed to have reformed. In addition, a post-credits scene is added in which Ninten&#39;s father is seen trying to reach his son on a telephone, apparently with some urgent news.&#xA;Note that the game is mostly nonlinear and the final party does not have to consist of Ninten, Ana and Lloyd.</desc>

          <desc>Drivers earn thousands of dollars by competing in hydroplane races, setting track records, rescuing stranded people, and collecting cash bonuses. With these winnings they can repair or upgrade various components of the hydroplane to improve racing performance and remain competitive in the increasingly-difficult races. Eliminator Boat Duel offers three difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, and Expert. Completing a race at a lower difficulty level advances the player to the next higher one. At each difficulty level, the player&#39;s hydroplane can be damaged from impact with animals, the opponent&#39;s hydroplane, and various stationary objects. A false start is penalized with a $2,000 fine. For most of a race, players control their hydroplanes from a bird&#39;s-eye view, and the screen scrolls in multiple directions; but in one segment of the race, the graphical perspective changes to a third-person tracking mode. In a single-player game, the player competes first with Seasick Sidney (in Easy mode), with Aquarius Rex (in Normal mode), or with Surfer Bob (in Expert mode). The player then competes against Vicious Vicky, Weird Willy, Mangler Mike, Veronica Alabaster, and Disaster Don (the reigning World Champion), respectively. To win, the player must defeat each opponent one-against-one on three unique race courses. Eliminator Boat Duel has 24 unique race courses.</desc>

          <desc>Exodus is a video game that was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System by Color Dreams through its Wisdom Tree label in 1991. Like all Wisdom Tree games, Exodus was not officially licensed by Nintendo. According to the game&#39;s instruction manual, the player controls the biblical figure Moses as he leads the Israelites to the promised land, meaning he goes through a labyrinth. Moses has the ability to shoot glowing &#34;W&#34;s, which signify the word of God, to defeat enemies and remove obstacles. To finish each level, Moses must acquire five question marks as well as a certain amount of manna while avoiding enemies such as magicians and soldiers. After a level is completed, the player must answer five multiple choice bible-related questions before advancing to the next level. After answering enough questions correctly, the player is rewarded with an extra life. Exodus, like many Wisdom Tree games, is a modified version of a Color Dreams game, in this case Crystal Mines. It was later ported to the Game Boy. Wisdom Tree would later release a sequel to Exodus, titled Joshua, featuring slightly improved graphics and gameplay.</desc>

          <desc>The game&#39;s protagonist is Bonk, a strong caveboy who battles anthropomorphic dinosaurs and other prehistoric themed enemies.  Bonk&#39;s mission is to rescue Princess Za (a small pink Pleisiosaur-type reptile) who has been kidnapped by the evil King Drool (a large, green Tyrannosaurus-type dinosaur).  In the Arcade version, Bonk is also assisted by a female version of himself.  Bonk attacks enemies by &#34;bonking&#34; them with his large, invincible forehead.  Bonk starts the game with three hearts&#39; worth of health, which are depleted to blue as Bonk takes damage and three extra lives.  Bonk&#39;s health can be restored in increments by collecting fruits and vegetables.  Bonk can also collect pieces of meat as power-ups; these lend him special abilities and make him stronger.  There are three stages of power-up: his normal self, a second stage during which he can stun enemies by pounding on the ground and a third stage where he becomes temporarily invulnerable.  Meat can be found in two varieties: big meat and small meat.  The effects of meat are additive but wear off over time.  A small meat gives Bonk the second stage of meat power but will eventually decay into the first stage of meat power, and then back into regular Bonk.  Eating a small meat while in stage two will put Bonk into the third, invincible stage of meat power.  And eating either size of meat while in the third stage of meat power-up will reset the timer on Bonk&#39;s meat power.  Bonk can occasionally collect red heart power-ups that refill an entire heart worth of health, or even more rarely, a large red heart which restores all of Bonk&#39;s missing health.  There are also two rare, blue heart power-ups in the game which will increase Bonk&#39;s maximum health by one heart.  Bonking an enemy will typically knock it backward and slightly into the air.  Defeating an enemy yields points and also releases a small &#34;smiley&#34; power-up.  Bonk&#39;s smileys are totaled at the end of each stage after defeating the boss of that stage.  The player is given additional points and a caveman type congratulation based on how many smileys were collected.</desc>

          <desc>In the NES version of Family Feud, the game tried to recreate the look and feel from the original Richard Dawson-hosted series, even going as far as to include a Dawson-like host who kissed the female characters in the game. (This differed from the game&#39;s packaging, which used the set from the Ray Combs era.) One or two players could play.&#xA;Just like the show, the object was to come up with answers to survey questions posed to 100 people. Correct answers were worth money, with $200 winning the game and the right to play Fast Money for $5,000, which was played exactly the same way as on the show (at least 200 points needed to win). $5 a point was awarded for unsuccessful playings of the round.&#xA;A player entered his answers by using the controller to scroll through the alphabet, contained in a string along the bottom of the screen; the answer had to be completed within a time limit. Reasonable similies to correct answers were accepted, and slight misspellings were also recognized.&#xA;Once a player won, they were given two options. The first was to stop playing, with the other being to continue on. A champion retired after winning over $20,000 automatically unless they were defeated.&#xA;If a computer-controlled family wins the game, no Fast Money is played with an excuse given to the form of &#34;Due to (EXCUSE), the (NAMES) will not be playing Fast Money today&#34;. Excuses used include &#34;tax considerations&#34; and &#34;a birth in the family&#34;.</desc>

          <desc>Dance Aerobics is a chance to get fit by following the movements of an aerobics instructor.&#xA;&#xA;Players use side B of the Power Pad accessory (a floor mat with 12 pads in a 4 by 3 grid) to follow the movements of an aerobics instructor. To succeed the player must press the pads with there feet and hands at the same time as the on screen aerobics instructor. Any missed movements are recorded on a mistake counter and 10 missed movements will fail the level. The routines (a set of repeated movements) start slow and simple with a bit of no-penalty practise time however as the player gets better the routines get more complex with less practices time. Each level has a set number of routines that increase with each level from 4 at the start to a total of 32 on the final level (level 7). At the successful completion of each level the player will get a pass stamp which they can enter later to skip that level.</desc>

The game utilizes the Nintendo Power Pad; to control your on screen character you will need to run in place on the Power Pad to make your character run, and actually jump to make him jump. In the basic game you need to run and jump your way to the finish line as fast as possible. Some additional game variations are available, such as the belly bump ball (you need to roll a giant ball through the obstacle course by running into it), the crab walk (make it to the finish line walking like a crab!), the water cross (water is found on the track; if you mistime your jump and land in the water you need to swim to get out costing you valuable time), the bubble run (racing through the course inside a giant bubble), or the skateboard race. Several cooperative games are included as well, including a tug of war, relay race, and six legged race.</desc>

          <desc>Opa-Opa is at it again in this zany return to his original homeland some ten years later. Welcome to Fantasy Zone II where perils are great and rewards even greater. During your visit you&#39;ll discover that peace is at stake once again and those who threaten it are more cunning and wicked than before. So beware, the evil Blackhearts are near and they&#39;re not alone. Scores of unusual and seemingly innocent creatures will enthusiastically approach you. But don&#39;t be fooled. They&#39;re not here to help. They&#39;re henchmen for the dark powers of the Blackhearts. And they&#39;ll sabotage every chance you&#39;ve got to protect the warp gates from total ruin. So fight valiantly, because just when you think you&#39;ve made it, the Blackhearts will be waiting.&#xA;&#xA;This game is a port of the original Arcade game of the same name, made by Sega.</desc>

          <desc>The Nintendo Entertainment System version of the game is a simplified version that allows players to practice up to six laps or qualify for every Formula One race of the season using metric units (kilometres per hour instead of miles per hour). It was one of the few 8-bit Formula One video games to adequately represent the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve as having an urban background along with several other urban race tracks represented in the 1992 Formula One season. Tire wear is possible resulting in trips to the pit crew for maintenance and repairs. A radio allows communication with the crew chief; he will advise whether repairs are necessary. The top speed of the vehicle is 325 kilometres per hour and turbo is not used in the game.&#xA;Before the first qualifying session can take place, the player must insert his name and his nationality. The name can be up to 10 characters long and the country has to fit into a three-character field. Since the game doesn&#39;t verify if the three-letter code matches up to a real nationality, it doesn&#39;t matter if the player makes up a nationality for a fictional country.</desc>

          <desc>Field Combat is a 1985 arcade video game in which the player fights as a single commanding officer in a generic futuristic battlefield. The Family Computer version of Field Combat was later released for the Wii&#39;s Virtual Console service exclusively in Japan on June 12, 2007.&#xA;&#xA;The object of the game is to make it all the way to the end of the battlefield using the Genesis; a warship that can fire off missiles. While the player controls the blue forces, the player must defeat the Red forces without dying in the process by either avoiding or shooting helicopters, infantrymen, and tanks. An interesting characteristic of the game is that it is possible to ask for reinforcements from an army, which the player possesses, by pressing both the A and B buttons at the same time. Whenever the player runs out of units to aid him in battle, he can use his special weapon to &#34;absorb&#34; the enemies and add them to his army.&#xA;&#xA;The game used Richard Wagner&#39;s Ride of the Valkyries as its background music. There is also an enemy UFO like spaceship that, when in battlefield, attempts to grab and escape with a player friendly unit (if there is any on the battlefield).It will also engage into air-to-air battle with a friendly helicopter (if there is any).</desc>

          <desc>Final Fantasy II features gameplay similar to that of its predecessor, Final Fantasy. The player can freely roam an overworld containing several towns and dungeons. A menu-based system allows the player to outfit each character with equipment and up to twooften disposableitems for battle. Magic spells are assigned to the character from the item menu, and certain spells, such as &#34;Cure&#34;, can be used outside of battle. The player can also save their progress on the overworld. Weapons, armor, items, and magic spells can be purchased at shops, and townspeople provide useful information for the player&#39;s progression through the game. One new feature is the &#34;Word Memory&#34; system: when in conversation with non-player characters (NPCs), the player can &#34;ask&#34; about and &#34;memorize&#34; special keywords or phrases, which can later be repeated to other NPCs to gain more information or unlock new actions. Similarly, there exist a handful of special items that can be shown to NPCs during conversation or used on certain objects, which have the same effect. Characters and monsters are no longer separated into separate windows in the battle screen as they were in Final Fantasy I, and players can see their current and total hit points below the battle. Players can also fight with less than four characters in their party, which was not possible in the first game. Final Fantasy II introduced the chocobo, the signature Final Fantasy mascot, which lets characters ride to a location at great speed without being attacked by enemies. The recurring character Cid was also introduced in II; a character of the same name has appeared in every main-series game since.&#xA;&#xA;On the overworld and within dungeons, (that image was banned because it came from a ROM site) random encounters with enemies can be fought to improve each character&#39;s attributes. Unlike the original Final Fantasy, players could not upgrade their characters&#39; classes. The game is also one of the few games in the series to not use experience-based levels. Instead, each character participating in battle develops depending on what actions they take. For instance, characters who use a particular type of weapon frequently will become more adept at wielding a weapon of that type, and will also increase in physical strength and accuracy. Attributes include hit points, magic points, magic power, stamina, strength, spirit, agility, intelligence, and evasion. Players can also increase their ability to wield certain types of weapon, and repeated use in combat causes the ability to level up. Hit points (HP) and magic points (MP) increase with their use; a character who takes a heavy amount of damage in a battle might earn an increase in maximum HP, while a character who uses a lot of MP during battle might increase their maximum MP. This experience system had several unintended consequences that allowed characters to gain much more experience than intended, such as players having their characters attack each other and repeatedly cast spells, thus causing their HP and abilities to grow extensively. Final Fantasy II uses the same turn-based battle system seen in the original Final Fantasy, with battle parties consisting of up to four characters at a time. The game introduces a &#34;back row&#34; in battle, within which characters or enemies are immune to most physical attacks, but can be harmed with bows and magical attacks.</desc>

          <desc>The gameplay of Final Fantasy III combines elements of the first two Final Fantasy games with new features. The turn-based combat system remains in place from the first two games, but hit points are now shown above the target following attacks or healing actions, rather than captioned as in the previous two games. Auto-targeting for physical attacks after a friendly or enemy unit is killed is also featured for the first time. Unlike subsequent games in the series, magical attacks are not auto-targeted in the same fashion.&#xA;The experience point system featured in Final Fantasy makes a return following its absence from Final Fantasy II. The character class system featured in the first game in the franchise also reappears, with some modifications. Whereas in the original game the player chooses each character&#39;s class alignment at the start of the game, Final Fantasy III introduces the &#34;job system&#34; for which the series would later become famous. Jobs are presented as interchangeable classes: in the Famicom version of the game, all four characters begin as &#34;Onion Knights&#34;, with a variety of additional jobs becoming available as the game progresses. Any playable character has access to every currently available job. Switching jobs consumes &#34;capacity points&#34; which are awarded to the entire party following every battle, much like gil. Different weapons, armor and accessories, and magic spells are utilized by each job. A character&#39;s level of proficiency at a particular job increases the longer the character remains with that job. Higher job levels increase the battle statistics of the character and reduce the cost in capacity points to switch to that job.&#xA;Final Fantasy III is the first game in the series to feature special battle commands such as &#34;Steal&#34; or &#34;Jump&#34;, each of which is associated with a particular job (&#34;Steal&#34; is the Thief&#39;s specialty, while &#34;Jump&#34; is the Dragoon&#39;s forte). Certain jobs also feature innate, non-battle abilities, such as the Thief&#39;s ability to open passages that would otherwise require a special key item. It is also the first game in the series to feature summoned creatures which are called with the &#34;Summon&#34; skill.</desc>

          <name>Fire Emblem - Ankoku Ryuu to Hikari no Tsurugi (Japan)</name>
          <desc>The Fire Emblem series of turn-based tactics games centers around moving units through a map grid in order to defeat the opposition. Players use strategic movements and positioning to complete mission objectives such as seizing a base, surviving for a number of turns, or defeating a boss. Many conventions of traditional console role-playing games are also present; for example, there is extensive use of scripted cutscenes to advance the story, units gain experience points and grow stronger over the course of the campaign, and the player can visit shops to outfit characters with weapons and equipment. Depending on the game, these events may take place during or in-between battles.&#xA;The combat system bases itself on a rock-paper-scissors method of fighting, as each weapon type has both an advantage and a disadvantage against other types. Starting in the fourth game, Fire Emblem: Seisen no Keifu, the weapon triangle has been lance beats sword, sword beats axe, and axe beats lance. Bows are unaffected by the triangle, can attack from a distance, and do higher amounts of damage against flying units like pegasi, but this is offset by the bow-wielder&#39;s inability to counter-attack melee strikes. A similar magic triangle exists in some games. In the Game Boy Advance Fire Emblem games, light beats dark, dark beats anima, and anima beats light. In other games, fire beats wind, wind beats thunder, and thunder beats fire. Magic and certain axes and spears can be used either from a distance or in melee range.&#xA;Unlike in most other games, most weapons in the Fire Emblem series have a finite number of uses and will eventually break. Therefore, the player must often buy replacement weapons or spend gold to have broken weapons repaired. Typically, weaker weapons allow more uses than more powerful ones, and are often more accurate.</desc>

The object of the game is to rescue pets from trees and people from houses in the immediate neighborhood. There are 2 parts to this task: the first part involves navigating the maze-like streets from an overhead perspective in order to find the troubled residence. Once the house is reached, the second part of the job is to maneuver the firetruck&#39;s ladder underneath the person or animal in need of rescue, from a side perspective, and letting them down to safety.</desc>

          <name>Fist of the North Star (USA)</name>
          <desc>Fist of the North Star is a side-scrolling action game developed by Shouei System for the Nintendo Entertainment System, originally released in Japan by Toei Animation in 1987 and in North America by Taxan in 1989. The game is based on the manga series Fist of the North Star and is the second of four games based on the franchise that were released for the Family Computer in Japan and the only one with an overseas version. The game&#39;s plot is adapted from the second anime series, Hokuto no Ken 2, and covers the Gento Kken story arc. The North American version is simply titled Fist of the North Star and is not to be confused with the original Hokuto no Ken for the Famicom, which was released exclusively in Japan. Despite being based on Hokuto no Ken 2, the North American cover artwork depicts Kenshiro fighting against Toki, who appears only in the first anime series.</desc>

          <desc>In a mysterious region of China, Ryuhi, was born and raised in high mountain tops. There he received instruction from his wise teacher, Juan. At a young age he became a master of Kempo. One day, his teacher Juan was attacked and robbed of the Secret Scrolls of Hiryu-no-Ken, of which he was the author. Ryuhi possessed the 6th volume of the Secret Scrolls, the Shingan No Sho, or Book of the Mind&#39;s Eye which Juan had managed to save. Ryuhi begins his journey to Shorinji as a last request from a dying Juan. Gengai, the bishop of Shorinji welcomed the little Ryuhi, and begins to train him in Shorinji Kempo. Six years later, they received a letter of challenge from the Tusk Soldiers, a mysterious organization of enemies of the Shorinji. Ryuhi is determined to take part in the upcoming &#34;World Tournament of Contact Sports&#34; as a representative of Shorinji. His motive is to prevent the Tusk Soldiers from becoming champions of Contact Sports at the tournament. After learning from Gengai that it was the Tusk Soldiers who attacked his teacher and robbed him of the Secret Scrolls, he leaves for the World Tournament. There are two different types of gameplay. Journey levels are side-scrolling levels where Ryuhi must defeat five bosses and find certain items valuable to the mission. The tournament levels are where the player gets to fight one-on-one against enemies in the same way as the first game in the series released in 1985, Shanghai Kid. The player must go through the game twice to get the true ending. All six scrolls must be collected the first time through to get the first ending. The second time through the player needs to collect all six scrolls again, along with four crystal balls. The crystal balls can only be found in the second quest. However, players can miss one of these items and finish the game, but the true ending will not be received.</desc>

          <desc>In an unexplored region of China wrapped in mystery, Ryuhi, a boy, was born and brought up in high mountain tops. There he received instruction from his wise teacher, Juan. Though he was young, he made himself a master of Kempo. One day, his teacher Juan was attacked and robbed of the Secret Scrolls of Hiryu-no-Ken, of which he was the author. Ryuhi possessed the 6th volume of the Secret Scrolls, the Shingan-no Sho, or book of the mind&#39;s eye which Juan had managed to save. Ryuhi begins his journey to Shorinji in compliance with Juan&#39;s last request. Gengai, the bishop of Shorinji welcomed the little Ryuhi, regarded as one of the titans of Shourinji Kempo. Six years later, they received a letter of challenge from the Tusk Soldiers, a mysterious organization of enemies of the Shorinji. Ryuhi is determined to take part in the upcoming &#34;World Tournament of Contact Sports&#34; as a representative of Shorinji. His desire is to prevent the Tusk Soldiers from becoming champions of Contact Sports at the tournament. Ryuhi heard from Gengai that in truth it was the Tusk Soldiers who attacked his teacher and robbed him of the Secret Scrolls. As he leaves for the World Tournament, his thoughts are on his teacher Juan and keeping the fighting spirit burning. The game features combat in a variety of formats, such as kicking and using fireballs to repel monsters in scrolling stages, a system during one-on-one duels against Tusk Soldiers or a pair of martial arts tournaments where the player must attack a mark that appears on their opponent&#39;s body, or defend the area when it appears on them (this system is similar to Culture Brain&#39;s original Flying Dragon for the NES), and RPG-style command battles against monster bosses. When confronted by a Tusk Soldier or other otherworldly villain, Rick can change into a costumed superhero form or switch with one of his teammates. The player must switch to Flying Warrior form to use the characters&#39; magic powers and defend themselves from the Tusk Soldiers&#39; magic spells.</desc>

          <desc>Players control one of six camp counselors in a sidescrolling adventure perspective. The counselor starts with an arcing rock, attempting to find and kill Jason. Along the paths, players will find cabins, a lake, and caves, with all but the cabins having enemies such as zombies, crows, and wolves attacking the player-character. Players may upgrade their weapon upon finding a new one. A timed alarm appears at certain intervals, requiring players to find Jason before he kills a child or another counselor. Using the map, players must navigate their way to Jason&#39;s location and defeat him. If they do not make it there in time, Jason will kill the counselors and children.</desc>

However, a man named Victar, who comes from a small village, has a sword that can destroy the demon. The blade had previously been split up into pieces, though, and Victar must travel through three worlds to get back the three broken pieces in order to restore the sword to defeat the demon</desc>

          <name>Fun House (USA)</name>
          <desc>The general gameplay concept is that each level is like a child&#39;s version of The Running Man with a basic top-down view. Players must throw tomatoes skillfully at a series of easy-to-hit targets. Some elements of the game are indirectly taken from the classic arcade game Pole Position (except that the player does not have the option to play as a Formula One vehicle).&#xA;In order to make it to the next level, the player must make it from the starting line to the finish within the time limit with a young child on inline skates. Otherwise, the player loses a chance and the player must start the stage over again. The host of the televised game show, J. D. Roth, congratulates players for winning a stage while taunting the player with late 1980s/early 1990s sarcasm when he loses a &#34;chance.&#34; Icy floors and slime colored ramps offer an additional challenge to the player. There are 72 rooms in the entire Fun House; with targets that are either numbered or given a generic target graphic. Each room has a name that usually gives a clue about how the room&#39;s design is implemented. Although the player is given three chances to successfully navigate the entire Fun House, collecting 25 silver coins acts as a 1-up. Warp zones will allow players to access the more difficult levels of the Fun House at an earlier time; thus allowing gamers who are pressed for time a chance to beat the game with a higher level of risk.</desc>

          <desc>A Boy and His Blob: Trouble on Blobolonia is a side-scrolling platformer in which the character and his friend Blob (full name Blobert) travel together on Earth and on Blobert&#39;s home planet Blobolonia in a quest to defeat an evil emperor. Blobert can change into several different items when he is fed jelly beans. A licorice jelly bean, for instance, will change Blobert into a ladder, while a honey jelly bean will turn him into a hummingbird. Most of these transformations can be remembered mnemonically due to a correlation between the flavor of the jelly bean and the item that results. Whistling at Blobert causes him to change back, often with a musical accompaniment similar to the main theme.</desc>

          <desc>At the beginning of the game the player selects a one player or two player game. The objective as one of the members of the G.I. Joe team is to eliminate any threats from Cobra and to capture eight Cobra operatives. The game cannot be completed if too many members of either side are placed in jail, other members are released to perpetuate the game.&#xA;Two modes of play are used; overhead vehicular combat sections, where the player controls a member of the G.I. Joe Special Forces, and one-on-one fights with Cobra operatives. In the overhead combat portion of the game, the player could select one of eight Joe team members (such as Snake-Eyes), to face off in combat against one of eight Cobra agents (such as Zartan). There are different geographical locations, such as woods, desert and arctic tundra. Each character had access to a vehicle from the G.I. Joe series, such as the Dragonfly helicopter, Rattler plane, M.O.B.A.T. or H.I.S.S. tank.&#xA;The one-on-one melee battle portion of the game featured sixteen characters available for the Joe team: Duke, Scarlett, Recondo, Torpedo, Snake-Eyes, Roadblock, Spirit, Zap, Gung-Ho, Snow Job, Blowtorch, Stalker, Ace, Wild Bill, Steeler, and Clutch. The Joes were pitted against eight Cobras: Destro, the Baroness, Zartan, Firefly, Cobra Commander, Storm Shadow, Major Bludd, and Scrap-Iron.</desc>

          <desc>The objective of Galaga is to score as many points as possible by destroying insect-like enemies. The player controls a starfighter that can move left and right along the bottom of the playfield. Enemies swarm in groups in a formation near the top of the screen, and then begin flying down toward the player, firing bombs at the fighter. The game ends when the player&#39;s last fighter is lost, either by colliding with an enemy or one of its bullets, or by being captured.&#xA;Galaga introduces a number of new features over its predecessor, Galaxian. Among these is the ability to fire more than one bullet at a time, a count of the player&#39;s &#34;hit/miss ratio&#34; at the end of the game, and a bonus &#34;Challenging Stage&#34; that occurs every few levels, in which a series of enemies fly onto and out of the screen in set patterns without firing at the player&#39;s ship or trying to crash into it. These stages award a large point bonus if the player manages to destroy every enemy.&#xA;Another gameplay feature new to Galaga is the ability for enemies to capture the player&#39;s fighter. While the player is in control of just one fighter, a &#34;boss Galaga&#34; (which takes two shots to kill) periodically attempts to capture the fighter using a tractor beam. If successful, the fighter joins the enemy formation. If the player has more lives remaining, play resumes with a new fighter. The captured fighter flies down with the enemy that captured it, firing upon the player just like normal enemies, and can be shot and destroyed. The player can free the fighter by destroying the boss Galaga while in flight, causing the captured fighter to link up with the player&#39;s current fighter, doubling his or her firepower but also making a target twice as large.&#xA;Galaga has an exploitable bug that can cause the attackers to stop firing bullets at the player, due to a coding error. In addition, similar to the famous &#34;Split-Screen bug&#34; in Pac-Man, a bug exists in Galaga in which the game &#34;rolls over&#34; from Level 255 to Level 0. Depending on the difficulty setting of the machine, this can cause the game to stall, requiring that the machine be reset or power-cycled in order to start a new game.</desc>

          <desc>Battle Tank is an action video game released by Absolute Entertainment in September 1990 for the Nintendo Entertainment System.  The game is similar to the Atari game Battlezone, and supports one player.  It was considered to be a poorly designed game, as it was intended to become a space flight game for the Commodore 64 during its development.</desc>

          <desc>Based on the hit cartoon, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles has players go up against Shredder and his Foot Clan followers. Leonardo&#39;s weapon are the Katana Blades, which makes it easy to strike far and fast. Raphael carries a Sai in each of his three fingered fast hands. His striking range is short but a little more powerful than Leonardo. Michaelangelo uses Nunchuks, and Donatello, a master of the Bo has some serious reach and power though he is a bit slow to strike. Unlike most games, rather than just give the plot at the beginning, here the story unravels throughout the adventure. First Shredder gets Beebop and Rocksteady to capture the Turtles friend April O&#39;Neal. Once April is rescued it turns out that Shredder has set eight bombs around the local dam. The dam though was a ploy to lure the Turtles away from their lair so that Mechaturtle, another of Shredder&#39;s minions, could kidnap Splinter.</desc>

Use your Land of Mongols to build an empire on the bodies of your enemies and the rubble of their conquered cities. With skill, cunning, diplomacy and luck, all of Europe and Asia could be yours.

Science and advanced technology have been abandoned, though the old ways of magic have survived. The survivors of the terrible destruction built a floating &#34;Tower&#34; to prevent any future cataclysms, as its occupants would have the power to govern the world due to the Tower&#39;s weapons systems. A man known as Emperor Draygon, however, has revived the forbidden ways of science and combined them with magic. With these skills, he controls the world&#39;s last remaining military power and seeks to conquer what&#39;s left of the planet by attempting to enter the Tower</desc>

These can be found by blowing open doors with bombs that are dropped by enemies. Also hidden behind doors are power-ups and other Goonies to rescue. Trying to stop you are enemies such as rats, skeletons, and even members of the Fratelli Gang. Bonus points can be gained by picking up diamonds and other valuables, rescuing the other Goonies, or by dispatching enemies with your slingshot or kicking them.</desc>

          <desc>Gotcha! is an NES Zapper title based on the &#34;sport&#34; of paintball, and loosely tied into the paintball-themed movie caper of the same name. You are required to traverse three different battle zones, grab the opposing teams&#39; flag from the opposite end of the field, and make it back to your flag without getting shot. One hand controls the Zapper while the other must hold the controller, since the D-Pad controls your movement up and down the field. Limited ammo is also a concern, as is the ability for the computer team to snag your flag and return it to their base to win. You can chase down and tag the flag carrier yourself to prevent this.</desc>

          <desc>Gizmo is trapped inside Clamp Centre by the evil Gremlins. Your mission? Help him battle his way to the control center and rid the city forever of the Gremlin menace! It&#39;s not going to be easy. You&#39;ll have to use cunning and wits to survive with only the weapons you find inside Clamp Centre... matches, a flashlight, tomatoes, and a homemade bow and arrow. But, if you&#39;re lucky, the door to Mr. Wing&#39;s Magic Shop may mystically appear... and let you buy some very special - and powerful - items to help you. This game has all the traps, mazes, and lightning quick moves to push your skill to the limits. And it has graphics that seem to come alive on the screen. Gremlins. Stopping them is not going to be easy. Don&#39;t say we didn&#39;t warn you!</desc>

Because not only are the diamonds hard to find, but you only have 24 hours to find them! What&#39;s more, you&#39;ll have to think fast and shoot even faster, because ferocious monsters, diving airplanes and hungry man-eating sharks will stop at nothing to prevent you from getting to the diamonds.

          <desc>A summer offensive in the year 1999. Never in your military career have you been in such a hot spot, as the world&#39;s most threatening power, Sheik Toxic Moron, deploys his arsenal of TechnoScorch Weapons. To achieve total victory over 4 intense levels, you must possess numerous skills, including precision reflexes for air combat, a cut throat mentality for land assaults, the brains to gather secrets from underground informants, and a keen sense for surviving 3-D battle mazes. If you&#39;ve got the guts to match those skills, then prepare for action. Because it&#39;ll really heat up the second you blast across the Sheik&#39;s firing line, piloting the world&#39;s most advanced super weapon - the Mach 4 Laser Invasion Helijet, which can go from hovering to a six &#34;G&#34; vertical climb in a heartbeat. From the moment you activate your Vulcan Cannons and Sidewinder Missiles, you&#39;ll take dead aim on an insane assault, featuring Anti-Copter Rocket Launchers, High-Altitude Bombers and Aerial Mines. But the battle&#39;s just begun, and there&#39;s no time to kill between firefights!</desc>

In driving stages Hart&#39;s vehicle can accelerate or slow down and fire his weapon straight ahead. During side-scrolling sequences, Hart can jump, duck, climb or use his selected weapon. Weapons that can be selected include a Katana sword, a pistol and a grenade-type weapon. These weapons feature limited ammunition with the exception of the katana. Power-ups include ammunition, coins, and health. In rail-shooting stages, similar to Operation Wolf, Hart can shoot enemies with his gun or throw grenades and pick up items by shooting at them.</desc>

However, a player can also change the way the gunman shoots through button combinations. A player can still die by getting shot or struck by enemies like in Commando but improve protection by getting special items, including a horse, for protection up to three hits; boots, for speed of movement; bullets, for faster shots; and rifles, for shot length. These items are found by shooting barrels and rifles, boots, and bullets can stock up to five.</desc>

          <desc>The gameplay is very similar to that of Galaga but with an added twist: the game is presented in a forced 3D perspective, with the player&#39;s ship facing &#39;into&#39; the screen and able to move around the perimeter of an implicit circle - essentially, Gyruss was Galaga mapped onto a Tempest-like cylinder. This gameplay style is called a tube shooter, and Gyruss is one of the very few examples that exist. The familiar scrolling starfield of earlier space shooter games was arranged to fit the 3D perspective, with the stars coming into view at the centre of the screen and flying outward, giving the impression of the player&#39;s ship moving very fast through space.</desc>

He is armed with a mallet that he can swing at various enemies to defeat them, deflect certain projectiles or destroy bricks. He can also collect hearts to restore his health and carrots for bonus points. At the end of each level, Bugs Bunny had to use his mallet to defeat a Warner Brothers cartoon character such as Foghorn Leghorn, Sylvester, or the Tasmanian Devil. These other Looney Tunes characters are trying to stop Bugs because they are all jealous that Bugs gets all the attention.&#xA;Levels:&#xA;1: Grass land (Daffy Duck, Tweety Bird, Daffy, Wile E.

          <desc>Remember Tetris? The way those cubes kept coming at you? That was tricky enough, but what if they were half a dozen different hats instead? Derbies, baseball caps, cowboy hats, wizard hats, top hats and crowns? Well, that&#39;s the whole idea behind Hatris. The hats keep coming at you two at a time. All you have to do is stack them up five at a time and - poof - they&#39;re history. It sounds perfectly simple. Until you get into it. Then you&#39;ll wish you had six heads instead of one. Because this is the latest game from Alexey Pajitnov, the designer of Tetris, and his partner Vladimir Pokhilko. And anyone who could turn geometry into a contact sport is a force to be reckoned with. And this time they really want you to use your head. If you don&#39;t, you&#39;ll look pretty strange with that pile of hats on it!</desc>

Similarly to The Dragon&#39;s Trap, the player is theoretically able to explore this world from the beginning; however, many areas are too hazardous or impossible to traverse when the player controls only one character with his limited abilities.</desc>

Kitty&#39;s ribbon always stays on the left side of her ear; even if the player changes the orientation of the character.&#xA;She can defend herself with the use of a large mallet. Running into enemies will make her cry, which causes Kitty to get angry and lose a life. Points in the game are collected as money for the cash register. Allowing the time limit to expire will also cause the player to lose a life. However, there are infinite continues and losing the game score is the only penalty for &#34;game overs.&#34; There are 18 stages in the game and the game does not repeat itself after the 18th stage. While the second half of the game is more difficult then the first nine levels, they can be cleared once the player is accustomed to the game controls.</desc>

          <desc>The idea of Rad Racer is to race around a course, and make it to check points before the timer runs out. If a player hits another vehicle, road sign or tree at a high speed, the car crashes. Crashes take time and make it more difficult for the player to reach the check point. There are eight different levels of requiring increasing skill. Even if time runs out, the vehicle can continue to coast for awhile; if the vehicle reaches a checkpoint before running out of momentum, the game continues.</desc>

          <desc>In a mysterious region of China, Ryuhi, was born and raised in high mountain tops. There he received instruction from his wise teacher, Juan. At a young age he became a master of Kempo. One day, his teacher Juan was attacked and robbed of the Secret Scrolls of Hiryu-no-Ken, of which he was the author. Ryuhi possessed the 6th volume of the Secret Scrolls, the Shingan No Sho, or Book of the Mind&#39;s Eye which Juan had managed to save. Ryuhi begins his journey to Shorinji as a last request from a dying Juan. Gengai, the bishop of Shorinji welcomed the little Ryuhi, and begins to train him in Shorinji Kempo. Six years later, they received a letter of challenge from the Tusk Soldiers, a mysterious organization of enemies of the Shorinji. Ryuhi is determined to take part in the upcoming &#34;World Tournament of Contact Sports&#34; as a representative of Shorinji. His motive is to prevent the Tusk Soldiers from becoming champions of Contact Sports at the tournament. After learning from Gengai that it was the Tusk Soldiers who attacked his teacher and robbed him of the Secret Scrolls, he leaves for the World Tournament. There are two different types of gameplay. Journey levels are side-scrolling levels where Ryuhi must defeat five bosses and find certain items valuable to the mission. The tournament levels are where the player gets to fight one-on-one against enemies in the same way as the first game in the series released in 1985, Shanghai Kid. The player must go through the game twice to get the true ending. All six scrolls must be collected the first time through to get the first ending. The second time through the player needs to collect all six scrolls again, along with four crystal balls. The crystal balls can only be found in the second quest. However, players can miss one of these items and finish the game, but the true ending will not be received.</desc>

          <name>Hollywood Squares (USA)</name>
          <desc>Hollywood Squares is a NES puzzle game based on the television game show of the same name. Players have to either agree or disagree with fictitious celebrities to earn squares and make tic-tac-toe. Much like the TV series, winning one of the first two games is worth $500, the third game is worth $1,000 and the second game is always the &#34;Secret Square&#34; game. The winner then goes on to the bonus round, where they have to choose one of five keys and insert it into the proper car among the five offered. This version was based on the 1980&#39;s version hosted by John Davidson</desc>

          <desc>The game is set in a decadent cyberpunk-style future world in which everyone has extrasensory perception. These powers can also be used by the player characters when they confront the various monsters in the game through combat. The eventual target of the game is to defeat the villains. In order to accomplish this, the player&#39;s characters must go to the Ark City and eventually to outer space. Unlike the Final Fantasy series, the game does not give the player an automatic &#34;game over&#34; when it is impossible to win the battle. This makes it possible for players to accidentally walk into a walking dead situation every time they are forced to do battle with the game&#39;s monsters.</desc>

          <desc>A diplomatic mission in a foreign city is seized by political fanatics. Innocent lives are in jeopardy. Outrageous demands are being made for their safety. Only you and your elite crisis intervention team can rescue the ambassador and his helpless staff. Position your sharpshooters around the embassy&#39;s perimeter. Focus your sights on the curtained windows. Squeeze off rounds of cover fire to protect your assault squad. Once your men are inside, an electronic diagram of the building&#39;s floor plan provides your only guide down to the captives - and the awaiting enemy. Look sharp. Stay frosty. Rescue is an interactive action-adventure game that lets you control each member of your strike team through three different game scenarios. Avoid searching spotlights, dodge enemy gunfire, rappel down walls, and smash through windows. Neutralize your adversaries and liberate the embassy personnel!</desc>

          <desc>Based on the movie of the same name, the Soviet Union have been building in secret a Typhoon-class submarine with nuclear strike capabilities. This war machine has been named the Red October. While on its trial run, the captain, Marko Ramius has hijacked the submarine along with it&#39;s crew. They plan to defect to the United States. Naturally, such a weapon must not be allowed to fall into American plans, and so orders are issued among the Soviet forces to destroy the Red October.</desc>

          <desc>In Tiles Of Fate the object of the game is to clear the screen of all the tiles within the given time limit. This is done by selecting two tiles with matching symbols which will cause them to disappear due to the force of symmetry. However, the force of symmetry can only make two right angles at most, and can not pass through other tiles. To clear all the tiles, you will need to plan your moves carefully. To help out, you may discover one of three forces of fate under a tile which can be saved and used when you&#39;re stuck. The forces are The Flash of Chance (allows symmetry to affect any matching tiles on the board, even those surrounded by other tiles), The Force of Balance (will eliminate brick walls that block the path of symmetry) and The Flag of Knowledge (this will make your next move for you in case you can&#39;t spot what the best move is.) Also included is a level editor which lets you create your own tile challenges.</desc>

          <desc>When nightmares come to life... You discover you&#39;re not immortal! You&#39;re a mighty wizard in search of your lost master, Mordamir. Venture into the dungeon and slove the mysteries of each level. Unravel the secrets of The Immortal!&#xA;&#xA;The Immortal is an isometric action-adventure game.&#xA;&#xA;Your old mentor Mordamir has disappeared. Probably kidnapped. You&#39;re not too sure where he might be, but a dungeon is always a good place to look, so you seek out the nearest one and plunge into its depths. Beware: 8 levels of isometric death await.&#xA;&#xA;The Immortal is the prototype of a trial-and-error game. Progress is made by encountering a hazard, dying, solving the problem, encountering the next hazard. To solve a level, you have to know its traps and their patterns by heart. As frustrating as this may sound (it is), The Immortal quite cleverly balances annoyance with curiosity and graphical rewards.</desc>

          <desc>Impossible Mission II is a direct sequel to Epyx&#39;s 1984 game Impossible Mission. The game follows directly from the same plot, with Elvin Atombender seeking revenge, and the player having to stop him. The overall game structure and basic gameplay is mostly similar, but there are a few differences and new features.&#xA;&#xA;The game takes place in Elvin&#39;s fortress, which consists of nine towers. Each of the eight outer towers has a specific theme, such as computers, automobiles, furniture and so on. Each tower consists of several rooms connected by two vertical corridors with elevators and two horizontal corridors leading to other towers. This time, the corridors leading between different towers are locked, and can only be unlocked by figuring out a numerical puzzle.&#xA;&#xA;Each tower contains the numbers zero through nine in three different colors. The computer interface will allow you to try various number combinations to see if they are correct.</desc>

          <desc>The plot of the NES version follows the storyline of the original movie. At the onset of the game, Jones has just reached the Pankot Palace featured in the movie and is preparing to free the slave children, recover the missing Sankara Stones and defeat Mola Ram and his Thuggee entourage. The game differs from the original arcade version in many respects, including the layout and the manner in which one progresses through the game, but the plot remains unchanged in both versions.&#xA;&#xA;The player advances through 12 levels (called &#34;waves&#34;), the first nine of which require Jones to travel through the palace and recover the Sankara Stones. In these stages, the player may restart the game with all items intact in the last area reached. Afterwards, if the player dies, they must return to the Chamber of Kali (Wave 9) and finish the game from that point. Each level also has a timer that goes from 99 to zero. If time runs out, the player is confronted by Mola Ram and loses one life and all of their items. All levels also contain mine cart rooms, where Jones can ride the rails through the levels across hazards and past enemies.</desc>

          <desc>HOWZAT!!? Your teammates let out a loud cry of appeal to the umpire. It seems like an eternity before he raises his arm to indicate the batsman is out. Out LBW for a duck! Your fast bowlers have been deadly accurate. Let&#39;s hope your batsmen can perform as well when it&#39;s your team&#39;s turn to bat. Warning! This is not a spectator sport. International Cricket puts you in total control of bowling, batting and fielding skills. Choose your team from the international line-up, select the best players for the day and may the best team win. International Cricket is a multi-player game that allows you to choose to play a single match or series of matches. Practice in the nets or go straight into the game. Whether you are batting or fielding, your skills will make the difference between winning and losing.</desc>

In the second stage, the goal is to find the magic spell which can be used to fight the elemental boss. Without the spell, it is impossible to damage the boss.

Handpicked by the master himself, 18 of the greatest holes in golf have now been linked together, including the 14th at St. Andrews, 18th at Muirfield, and 12th at Royal Lytham. All the elements of the major championships are here as well - the harsh winds of Scotland, the lightning fast greens of Augusta, Oakmont&#39;s death traps and the great ocean hazard at Pebble Beach. Trees are everywhere. Birdies are few. And it has more doglegs than a kennel. Even pin placements change from round to round, making double bogeys as common as pars. Up to a foursome can compete, or you can go it alone against a computerized Golden Bear. You also have the option of playing a skins game or stroke play. So get a grip on yourself. Then swing into action on a course as legendary as the man who designed it.</desc>

          <name>Joe &amp; Mac - Caveman Ninja (Europe)</name>
          <desc>The game stars the green-haired Joe and the blue-haired Mac, cavemen who battle though numerous prehistoric levels using, weapons such as boomerangs, bones, fire, flints, electricity, stone wheels, and clubs. The objective of the game is simply rescuing a group of girls who were kidnapped by a rival tribe of cavemen. The gameplay is somewhat similar to Contra and has a Gauntlet-style health system, where the player loses health over a period of time apart from in boss battles. This health system is also not unlike that of Sega&#39;s Wonder Boy. The game could be played in either single player or two player mode. In the two player mode, both characters could hurt each other. The game was also notable for its cartoony graphics, humor, and sound effects.&#xA;&#xA;The original arcade version had the distinction of allowing the player to select between different routes (much like Taito&#39;s Darius) at the end of a boss battle. Also, after defeating the final boss, the players can choose between three exits, each one leading to a slightly different ending sequence.</desc>

You call the plays, you throw the passes, run the ball, and make the tackles. It&#39;s third down and a long four long yards to the first down that will stop the clock. No time-outs left. The weak side linebacker is lined up inside his defensive end. They&#39;re coming! You check-off the play at the line of scrimmage and call for a quick pass to the tight end. He breaks it for a T.D.! Named for the quarterback who twice won the AFC Player of the Year Award, this is the game made for every kid who ever wanted to play the game as well as John Elway!</desc>

          <desc>Toki, known in Japan as JuJu Densetsu (JuJu?) is a 1989 shoot &#39;em up platformer arcade game, or a &#34;run and gun&#34; developed and published in Japan by TAD Corporation and published in North America by Fabtek. It features elements of tongue-in-cheek humor combined with the action. The player takes control of an enchanted ape who must battle hordes of jungle monsters with energy balls from his mouth (described humorously as &#34;monkey-spit&#34; or &#34;monkey-vomit&#34; by some gamers). The ultimate goal is to destroy the evil wizard who cast a spell on you; therefore transforming yourself from an ape back into a human, and rescuing the kidnapped princess. The game was ported to several video game consoles and home computers.</desc>

          <desc>This game can be played in two modes, either as Dr. Alan Grant or as a Velociraptor. Playing as each provides the user with an alternative story and level design. The climax of the game mirrored the unused climax of the film, in which Grant must defeat a pair of Velociraptors by causing the Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton in the Visitors Center to collapse on top of them. Grant himself is the final boss in the same location for the raptor storyline: your dinosaur character must cause the bone structure to collapse via specifically placed kicks to cause Grant to flee. A sequel was released using a new game engine and new artwork (with some of the original art as well), entitled Jurassic Park: Rampage Edition. In it, Grant&#39;s helicopter (that he just escaped on in the first game) crashes. Now he must deal not only with dinosaurs, but InGen as well. A new raptor must also make it off the island.</desc>

          <desc>Shadow of the Ninja can be played by up to two players simultaneously, with one player controlling Hayate (the male ninja) and the other as Kaede (the female ninja). In either mode, the player can decide which character they want to control before the game actually begins. There are no actual performance differences between either character.&#xA;The player character can run, crouch, climb ladders, attack, and jump like in most side-scrolling action games as well as hang onto an overhang and move under it. If the player has more than half of their vitality remaining, they can perform a special attack by holding a button for an extended period, summononing a thunderstorm that will damage all on-screen enemies, but at the cost of roughly half of their maximum vitality.&#xA;The player&#39;s default weapon is a katana, which can be traded for a kusarigama and vice-versa. The kusarigama has a longer range than the katana and can be swung upwards diagonally and horizontally. However, the kusarigama can only damage enemies from a specific distance and does not work as well at close range like the katana. If the player picks up a weapon they already have, its attack power will be strengthen by an increment of one level (with up to three attack levels). However, if the player takes too much damage, their weapon&#39;s strength will be reduced back to its previous level. There is also the possibility to use both weapons, if the player starts with the kusarigama and collects secret powerups hidden in some levels (for example in the central wheel of level 1.3). The player can also obtain shurikens and hand grenades as well, both which can only be used as long the player&#39;s supply lasts before the player reverts back to using the katana or kusarigama. All four weapons are obtained by destroying item boxes scattered throughout each stage, along with vitality potions. Something worth mentioning is the fact that the potions being offered in order to heal yourself if played by 2 players will have different colors, which depending if the color of the potion is the same as the character that use it, it will replenish a large amount of health but if the color of the potion is not the same it will heal less.&#xA;The game consists of five stages, with the first four stages being divided into three segments and the final stage into two. The player will fight numerous types of enemy characters throughout each stage, including bosses and sub-bosses. once a boss has been defeated it will explode, this explosion will heal players the closer they are from it, since actually the same amount of health from one stage will be carried to the next one until either recovered with potions or by dying. The game ends if the player loses all of their vitality and only five chances are provided to continue. If two players are playing the game, their continues will be shared.</desc>

Levels include the forest, moat, inside and outside of the castle. These levels repeat as the seasons change. The gameplay is side scrolling. Kage&#39;s moves include the ability jump extremely high in the air, grab and climb trees, block and attack with his sword, and throw shuriken. The game can be challenging at times though because the player dies in one hit. 2-players are supported, but must take turns.</desc>

          <desc>The princess has been kidnapped again, this time by a pair of menacing-looking figures. Locked in a tower, she manages to write a plea for help on a scrap of paper and then sends a paper airplane out of her prison. Miraculously, it reaches her boyfriend Yanchamaru who, being the upstanding samurai that he is, immediately sets out to save her.&#xA;&#xA;Kaiketsu Yanchamaru 3 is the final sequel to Kid Niki and is a significant departure from the first two games. Not only does the game feature full four-way scrolling and large maps to explore, but Yanchamaru himself sports a completely new look and numerous new abilities. His trademark spinning sword now seems to more closely resemble a b, and Yanchamaru can now use it to shoot waves of energy at foes, bounce on the end, spin in place, and even launch off of walls and corners. Taking a cue from Mega Man, he also now has the ability to slide through narrow spaces and underneath dangerous spikes.&#xA;&#xA;Each stage contains numerous keys and locked doors. Any key will open any door, and it is possible to complete a stage without even finding all the keys and doors. The final door in each stage leads to the boss room. After clearing each stage, your performance is tallied, and depending on what you did, bonuses such as points or lives are given.</desc>

          <desc>Think you can handle a real Martial Arts challenge? Then how about guiding Daniel-San through the series of hazards, obstacles, and challenges that stand in his path? But don&#39;t think that just being able to fight will get you through. This time it&#39;s not enough to just punch, kick and jump... this time your total martial arts training will be put to the test. Your discipline and inner control could be what saves your life. You must prove that you are capable of thinking, reasoning, and reacting. Catching a fly with your chopsticks or splitting blocks of ice with your bare hand is just as important as fighting face to face with your enemy. This challenge will take you to the streets of L.A., the back roads of Okinawa and many strange areas beyond. Always keep your mind clear and remember all that you&#39;ve been taught, and maybe... just maybe... you&#39;ll make it!</desc>

The player takes the role of an Antarctic penguin, racing to disparate research stations owned by different countries in Antarctica (excluding the USSR).&#xA;&#xA;The gameplay is similar to Sega&#39;s Turbo, but plays at a much slower pace, and features platform game elements. The penguin, later named Penta, must reach the next station before time runs out while avoiding sea lions and breaks in the ice. Throughout the levels, fish jump out of ice holes and can be caught for bonus points. The game, like many early video games, has no ending  when the player reaches the last station, the game starts from the first level again, but with increased difficulty.</desc>

          <desc>Dark powers summon a cold wind from the north. The terrifying gust surrounds Sir Graham&#39;s castle, and mysteriously sweeps his fortress and family into the prison of oblivion. It&#39;s a bitter omen that chills the bones of every man, woman and child in the once peaceful Kingdom of Daventry. Who or what is responsible for this royal theft, and the misery that ravages the heart of Daventry? Has the ruthless wizard Manannan cast another evil spell? Or are the Black Forest Witch and the unforgiving Ice Queen using sinister powers to promote their wicked cause? Only you can answer these questions, as you assume the role of Sir Graham, then set forth on an adventure that will test your intelligence, challenge your skill and rip your courage to shreds.</desc>

          <desc>Sun-bathed beaches from San Diego to Sydney are yours to conquer, as you challenge heavy-hitting volleyball superstars in world championship style competitions. From the opening serve to match point, the sand-blasting never stops. And to survive each grueling round, you must spike, crush, block and make daredevil returns. Timing and positioning are critical in this slam-fest, complete with aces, kills, digs and the dreaded hammer spike. Teamwork is crucial as well, since up to four players can compete at once. So hold nothing back, and bury your opponents in the sand. Because if your tandem wins three matches, you&#39;re qualified for the next big tournament, the next enormous challenge. But lose and you&#39;ll be just another couple of beach bums, washed-up like a pile of seaweed!</desc>

In a stadium hundreds of years from now, techno-gladiators do battle, combining contact with speed and finesse. Two five-man teams go for it, each fighting to deliver a three-kilo metallic energy sphere into the opponents goal zone. Teams challenge each other in a surreal arena that utilizes devices such as a warp tunnel, ball launcher, and magnetically charged bounce domes. Klashball features a complete league system. There are 11 rowdy teams, each with unique skills, strengths, and weaknesses. After each match the central computer analyzes the outcome and records the stats. Play against the computer or klash it out with a friend. If you&#39;re ready, take a trip into the 23rd century with Klashball. A game so real, it&#39;s in your face!</desc>

The player controls a small device which sits at the interface between the conveyor belt and the playing area, and can be moved left and right to catch the blocks and either deposit them in the playing area or push them back up the conveyor belt. The device can hold up to five blocks. A block which is not caught and placed in the playing area or pushed back up the belt is considered a drop. The blocks are solid colours, but there is also a flashing block which can be used as a wildcard on any colour.</desc>

          <desc>Castelian is a platform game with some distinctive unique features.  The player character, a small green creature called Pogo, is on a mission to destroy eight towers that have been built onto the sea by planting bombs at the towers&#39; peaks.  Pogo&#39;s progress is hindered by enemies and obstacles which he has to avoid in order to reach the top of the tower.  The actual game play happens at each tower in turn.  Pogo starts from the bottom and has to find his way up to the top.  The towers are cylinder-shaped and have ledges on their outside, either horizontal, forming stairs or connected by elevators.  Because of the cylindrical shape, the towers have no &#34;left&#34; or &#34;right&#34; edges, instead allowing Pogo to walk all around the tower.</desc>

To achieve total victory over 4 intense levels, you must possess numerous skills, including precision reflexes for air combat, a cut throat mentality for land assaults, the brains to gather secrets from underground informants, and a keen sense for surviving 3-D battle mazes. If you&#39;ve got the guts to match those skills, then prepare for action. Because it&#39;ll really heat up the second you blast across the Sheik&#39;s firing line, piloting the world&#39;s most advanced super weapon - the Mach 4 Laser Invasion Helijet, which can go from hovering to a six &#34;G&#34; vertical climb in a heartbeat. From the moment you activate your Vulcan Cannons and Sidewinder Missiles, you&#39;ll take dead aim on an insane assault, featuring Anti-Copter Rocket Launchers, High-Altitude Bombers and Aerial Mines. But the battle&#39;s just begun, and there&#39;s no time to kill between firefights!</desc>

It doesn&#39;t get rougher or trougher than the streets of L.A., where Riggs and Murtaugh take on every cheap low-life mercenary, street punk and dope dealer to get to the real slime behind big-time corruption. How much of your life, your future, are you willing to risk? As Riggs? As Murtaugh?</desc>

          <desc>You&#39;ve saved the innocent people of Gradius from the vile Bacterions. But now an even deadlier plague has slimed into the neighborhood. It&#39;s Zelos, an all-engulfing, planet-eating alien who&#39;s hungering to take a bite out of you! Only this time you don&#39;t have to rescue the millions of Gradians alone. You can call on a starfighter friend from the planet Latis, who&#39;ll fight beside you in his RoadBritish space destroyer. You&#39;ll both be gunning for max power-ups, with ripple lasers, plutonic missiles and impregnable force fields. But you better be on target. For this isn&#39;t your ordinary space scum. And to crush him you&#39;ve gotta soar through his guts, blast past his death traps and ultimately blow out his heart. Good luck, Commander. The galaxy&#39;s counting on you!</desc>

          <desc>Astyanax is a side-scrolling platform game. The controls are fairly simple: the A Button makes Astyanax jump, the B Button will attack with an axe called Bash, and a combination of up and attack will perform a special magic attack. The game also contains a few role-playing elements, such as weapons upgrades. It had a unique feature (for the time) of a bar that grows between attacks; the length of the bar determines how much damage Astyanax will do with his next attack. If one attacks rapidly, one&#39;s hits will do little damage, much unlike most games where a rapid succession of hits would all be equally damaging. A very similar system would be used in Secret of Mana some years later.</desc>

For reasons long forgotten, two mighty tribes went to war and touched off a blaze which engulfed them all. Without fuel they were nothing. Man began to feed on man. The gangs took over the highways, ready to wage war for a tank a gas. In the maelstrom of decay, ordinary men were smashed...men like Max -- a man who wondered out into the wasteland. And it was there, in that blighted place, that he learned what it takes to survive. &#xA;&#xA;And now it&#39;s your turn. Survive multiple levels of holocaust on the highways, mayhem in the mine-shafts, and anarchy in the arenas. Then face the final challenge -- if you dare.</desc>

          <desc>In the game, players must assemble a group of six adventurers and journey across the kingdom of Deruvia to keep the demon Dreax imprisoned in the eponymous magic candle, which has begun to melt. The game&#39;s world includes several towns and cities, two castles, and several dungeons and towers. Unlike many video games, one wins not by defeating a final enemy, but by collecting the necessary items and learning the necessary chants in order to preserve the magic candle. Players begin with one adventurer, a human hero called Lukas. Additional adventurers can be found in the game&#39;s two castles. Much of The Magic Candle&#39;s fun derives from discovering exactly what is needed to preserve the eponymous candle.</desc>

Mario and Luigi attempt to prevent this by switching the different columns of enemy characters back and forth so that they are positioned under different falling objects. If there is a chain of monsters within two yoshi egg shells, the egg shells will merge and a Yoshi will form, adding points and eliminating a group of monsters. The larger the chain of monsters between the two eggshells, the larger the Yoshi that is created will be.</desc>

          <desc>In NES Open Tournament Golf, you can play a round of golf on one of three different courses. One or two players can play in the U.S., Japan, or the U.K. and choose a stroke or match play game. Gameplay is from two point of views, starting with an overhead view allowing you to set up the shot and choose a club, then switching to a 3-D point of view. Hitting the ball uses the common power meter where tapping the button starts the meter, tap the button a second time to select the amount of power in the shot, then tap the button a third time to select the amount of slice or hook. If you are unable to finish a round in one play, NES Open Tournament Golf features a battery back-up allowing you to save the game and continue later.</desc>

Gameplay is from two point of views, starting with an overhead view allowing you to set up the shot and choose a club, then switching to a 3-D point of view. Hitting the ball uses the common power meter where tapping the button starts the meter, tap the button a second time to select the amount of power in the shot, then tap the button a third time to select the amount of slice or hook. If you are unable to finish a round in one play, NES Open Tournament Golf features a battery back-up allowing you to save the game and continue later.</desc>

          <desc>Mechanized Attack is an adaptation of an arcade shooting game where the player uses a machine gun to stage an assault on a tropical island that&#39;s home to a cyborg army. In this NES port, the player can use either a gamepad or the NES Light Zapper to carry out the mission. Battle through numerous stages beginning with an approach to the island. This first stage is held over the water and features an attack on a number of small gunboats, a helicopter and an entire battleship. As the player progresses through the stages of the island, the human (and even canine) enemies are revealed to be robots when the flesh is destroyed. At various junctures of the game, the player is allowed to choose which game path to pursue.</desc>

After their final confrontation, Wily&#39;s fortress begins to crumble. Proto Man appears in enough time to save Mega Man, but too late to save Wily, who is crushed under the rubble.</desc>

The journey is a difficult one though, because the castle is locked up tight and Milon doesn&#39;t have the keys. You will have to use your bubble attacks to fend off the castle baddies while busting up every block in sight trying to find all of the hidden treasure and other secrets throughout the game. Unlike most platformers, Milon&#39;s Secret Castle is less about defeating all of the enemies in an area, and more about scouring every bit of each room to find the secrets that lie within Garland Castle! Milo can uncover practically anything in the game. This includes: items, power-ups, money, shields, keys, level exits, even shops! The only way to get to each level boss is to find the right secret items!</desc>

Goofy assists with chauffeur and data processing duties. Mickey can venture into any of the following 6 territories: Yukon, Swamp, Forest, Jungle, Pyramid and Caribbean. In each area, his mission is to collect three diamonds that contain letters. Doing so will spell a word. Then, Mickey ventures to the end of the level and collects a large slab. If Mickey collects the three diamonds in the stage to spell a 3-letter word, Mickey spells the word with digitized audio samples and says the word, complete with an illustration. Then, the slab that Mickey collected at the end of the stage is fed by Goofy through a large machine that spits out a letter. It is up to the player to identify which letter this is.</desc>

The journey is a difficult one though, because the castle is locked up tight and Milon doesn&#39;t have the keys. You will have to use your bubble attacks to fend off the castle baddies while busting up every block in sight trying to find all of the hidden treasure and other secrets throughout the game. Unlike most platformers, Milon&#39;s Secret Castle is less about defeating all of the enemies in an area, and more about scouring every bit of each room to find the secrets that lie within Garland Castle! Milo can uncover practically anything in the game. This includes: items, power-ups, money, shields, keys, level exits, even shops! The only way to get to each level boss is to find the right secret items!</desc>

You and your trio of Impossible Mission Force agents will infiltrate a six level maze of unthinkable danger.  A fortress of international evil designed to sap every ounce of your brains and brawn.  At each turn you must fend off snipers and fire bomb maniacs.  Elude spy cameras and robot sentries.  Escape from countless enemies in hot pursuit.  All in your desperate search for booby-trapped clues, secret ID cards and life-saving switches.&#xA;  Any why?  Because the worldwide terrors known as the Sinister Seven have kidnapped Dr. &#34;O,&#34; his nuclear military defense system and IMF agent Shannon Reed, and now they threaten to wreak planetary chaos.&#xA;  Luckly, your agents are well schooled in the art of espionage and possess their own favored firepower, from rifles to remote control cluster bombs.  But that&#39;s no guarantee you&#39;ll make it past brutes like Slash Stiletto, Blitz Blizzardski and the Iron Claw.  If by chance you do, there&#39;s always the hyper speedboat chases through Venice, hand grenade ski runs down the Swiss Alps, and prison camps in the Pyrenees mountains.&#xA;  Remember, should you choose to accept this mission and fail, you, your Nintendo, and the world will self-destruct in five seconds.</desc>

All in your desperate search for booby-trapped clues, secret ID cards and life-saving switches.&#xA;  Any why?  Because the worldwide terrors known as the Sinister Seven have kidnapped Dr. &#34;O,&#34; his nuclear military defense system and IMF agent Shannon Reed, and now they threaten to wreak planetary chaos.&#xA;  Luckly, your agents are well schooled in the art of espionage and possess their own favored firepower, from rifles to remote control cluster bombs.  But that&#39;s no guarantee you&#39;ll make it past brutes like Slash Stiletto, Blitz Blizzardski and the Iron Claw.  If by chance you do, there&#39;s always the hyper speedboat chases through Venice, hand grenade ski runs down the Swiss Alps, and prison camps in the Pyrenees mountains.&#xA;  Remember, should you choose to accept this mission and fail, you, your Nintendo, and the world will self-destruct in five seconds.</desc>

          <desc>Bases Loaded 4 was Jaleco&#39;s last 8-bit entry in the long-running baseball series. The game featured slightly more elaborate animations than its predecessor, and much larger fielders. Removed was the goal to play a flawless game; instead the game featured more traditional modes, including exhibition games and full season play.&#xA;&#xA;Geared more toward faced-paced arcade gameplay than simulation, Bases Loaded 4 was not licensed by Major League Baseball or the Major League Baseball Players&#39; Association. Therefore, it did not feature real American (or Japanese, for that matter) teams or players.</desc>

The legends of the Playground are all here: Mr. Doc, Jammer, Legs, Bomber, Wiz, eight players in all. You can pit them one-on-one or two-on-two. You pick the court - Eastern or Western - and you pick the rules, too. You can play against the computer or one other player. Or you can even team up with another player against the computer. You can block shots, make steals, pass off or go strong to the hoop - in fact, you control just about everything in this ultra-realistic rendition of the playground game. Except, of course, the final score. But win or lose, you know you&#39;ve been in a game after you&#39;ve played a game of HOOPS!</desc>

          <desc>Walking home from a baseball game one evening, Mark gazed up at the misty sky. Suddenly, a blazing star plummeted to earth with a blinding light.

The creature told an eerie tale about his home planet, the Dark World, where evil monsters were terrorizing the helpless population. He was searching the galaxy for a warrior capable of freeing them from their terrible plight. The creature explained that Mark&#39;s bat was the perfect weapon for defeating the evil monsters. Mark considered the creature&#39;s proposal for a minute, then agreed to undertake the dangerous mission. After all, he thought, it sure beats going to school!</desc>

          <name>Mother (Japan)</name>
          <desc>Mother begins by telling the story of a young married couple from rural America who mysteriously vanished after a dark shadow covered their small country town. Two years later, the husband, George, returned as mysteriously as he vanished, and began a strange study in complete seclusion. His wife, Maria, was never heard from again.&#xA;The story then forwards to a year in the 1980&#39;s (1988 in the Japanese version), focusing on a 12 year old American boy, referred to as Ninten, whose home is attacked in a paranormal event. He possesses a striking resemblance to EarthBound&#39;s Protagonist, Ness. Instead of Ness, who has a blue and yellow striped shirt, red shoes and white socks, Ninten has a blue and yellow shirt with slightly thinner yellow stripes, and blue shoes and red socks. He is a huge fan of baseball and is a fan of penguins. His father calls him and explains how Ninten&#39;s great-grandfather studied PSI, and asks him to investigate a crisis occurring across the world. After rescuing and befriending a 7 year old girl named Pippi from the local cemetery in his hometown of Podunk, Ninten discovers the worldwide phenomenon is the work of an invading alien race. Ninten is then warped to the world of Magicant, where the land&#39;s ruler, Queen Mary, asks Ninten to find her song, the Eight Melodies, and play them to her. After returning to the real world, Ninten visits an elementary school in Merrysville and meets an 11 year old boy who is constantly teased for being a weakling, referred to as Lloyd (Loid in the English prototype). Ninten befriends Lloyd, and Lloyd joins Ninten on his adventure to find the Eight Melodies. The two then travel to the town of Snowman to deliver a lost hat to a girl with PSI power, referred to as 12 year old Ana, who tells Ninten she saw him in a dream, and joins the party in hopes of finding her missing mother.&#xA;After finding most of the Melodies, the party travels to the city of Valentine (Ellay in the English prototype), and the trio do karaoke at the Live House. Ninten is then harassed by the boss of the local Black Blood (Bla-Bla) Gang, referred to as Teddy, for attacking his gang members, and challenges him to a duel. After realizing Ninten is a formidable opponent, Teddy surrenders and joins Ninten&#39;s party in hopes of avenging his parents, who were killed at Holy Loly Mountain. Teddy replaces Lloyd in the party, who rests at the Live House. The party reaches a cottage at the base of Holy Loly Mountain (Mt. Itoi), where Teddy goes to make phone calls. Ana pulls Ninten into another room and asks him to be with her always. The two dance and confess their love to each other. Teddy enters the room, and the party begins to leave, when they&#39;re attacked by a powerful robot called R7038 a robot similar of what they encountered before in Advent Desert. The robot knocks out the entire party, but Lloyd arrives with a tank from a man they have met in Advent Desert during their travels and destroys the robot, but accidentally attacks the party as well. Teddy is critically wounded (possibly dead in the original Famicom version), and stays at the cottage to heal, while Lloyd rejoins the party.&#xA;The newly reformed trio takes a motor boat out on Holy Loly Lake, where they are pulled into a whirlpool into an underwater laboratory. There, they find a robot named Eve, who tells Ninten that she was built by George, who was taken to the ends of the universe and later returned. He built Eve with the purpose of protecting Ninten. The laboratory becomes flooded and the party is whisked back to the base of Holy Loly Mountain, where, with the aid of Eve, they climb the mountain. As the party approaches the mountain summit, another robot, R7038XX, attacks the party. Eve destroys the robot, but Eve is destroyed in the battle as well. Eve&#39;s scrapped remains sing Ninten the seventh of the Eight Melodies.&#xA;With seven of the melodies learned, Ninten and the others are warped to Magicant where Ninten sings the Eight Melodies to Queen Mary. Upon hearing the Eight Melodies, Queen Mary remembers the rest of the song. Queen Mary reminisces on how she loved an alien named Gyiyg (Giegue in the unreleased translation, and Giygas in EarthBound}}, as if he were her own child. She tells Ninten that he was always wagging his tail, except when she sang lullabies to him. Queen Mary then reveals she is George&#39;s wife, Maria, and, with her purpose complete, vanishes to return to George&#39;s side. Magicant, being only a mirage created by her conscience, vanishes with her.&#xA;The party is warped back to the top of Holy Loly Mountain, where the party discovers a strange grave. George&#39;s spirit visits the tomb and tells Ninten that his great-grandmother Maria spread her love in the form of melodies. Large rocks block the entrance to a cave inside Holy Loly Mountain, but Maria&#39;s conscious uses the last of her power to clear the entrance. Inside they discover human prisoners sealed within cylindrical tanks. One of the prisoners identifies Ana&#39;s hat and informs the party that her mother is among them, but that they must destroy the Mother Ship before attempting to rescue them.On the other side of the cave is where they encounter the Mother Ship and Gyiyg contained within a fluid-filled tank. Gyiyg expresses his gratefulness to Ninten&#39;s family, as Ninten&#39;s great-grandmother, Maria, raised him, but explained that George stole vital information from his people that could have been used to betray them, then stated that one of George&#39;s descendants, Ninten, was interfering with their plans and must be stopped. Gyiyg tells Ninten that he cannot be defeated by Ninten&#39;s &#34;meager&#34; powers, but offers to save Ninten alone if he boards the Mother Ship. Ninten declines, so Gyiyg tells Ninten to fall into a long sleep with the rest of the &#34;ugly Earth People&#34;. The party begins to sing the Eight Melodies, but Gyiyg attacks the party to quiet them. After several attempts, the party finishes the lullaby, and Gyiyg, calmed by Maria&#39;s motherly love, admits defeat, swearing he and Ninten will meet again. The Mother Ship flies off, leaving the heroes behind. In the original Famicom release, the game ended at this uncertain point, but it is extended in the English prototype and Mother 1+2 versions, and instead the party returns to the base of the mountain where the imprisoned humans are all revealed to have been freed. In the process, Ana is finally reunited with her mother. The heroes all return to their normal lives, and Teddy is revealed to have reformed. In addition, a post-credits scene is added in which Ninten&#39;s father is seen trying to reach his son on a telephone, apparently with some urgent news.&#xA;Note that the game is mostly nonlinear and the final party does not have to consist of Ninten, Ana and Lloyd.</desc>

          <desc>Ron Trainer, the hottest of the elite corps of Computer Master Debuggers is enjoying his first week of vacation in over two years. He&#39;s been busy keeping CPI running errorfree. CPI, the Central Programing Institute, is what allows the world to exist the way it does. It controls everything; from global databases and grids to holographic theater software as well as the simple timing of the traffic signals. But something is terribly wrong tonight... cities around the globe have lost their power and data feeds. There have been several major aerial collisions between passenger liners and heavy freighters and the skyways have been closed until global traffic control is back on-line. All power and light have been lost and the atmospheric control system can only continue to function on auxiliary power for the verge of collapse. There is rioting reported in several areas. What&#39;s going on??? This appears to be more than a simple system&#39;s bug... but how much more?</desc>

          <desc>In NES Open Tournament Golf, you can play a round of golf on one of three different courses. One or two players can play in the U.S., Japan, or the U.K. and choose a stroke or match play game. Gameplay is from two point of views, starting with an overhead view allowing you to set up the shot and choose a club, then switching to a 3-D point of view. Hitting the ball uses the common power meter where tapping the button starts the meter, tap the button a second time to select the amount of power in the shot, then tap the button a third time to select the amount of slice or hook. If you are unable to finish a round in one play, NES Open Tournament Golf features a battery back-up allowing you to save the game and continue later.</desc>

While Nintendo did not get the NFL license for this one, it did secure the license of the NFL Player&#39;s Association, so the 8 teams to choose from (all named after the appropriate NFL cities) are all stocked up with real pro players from the 1989 season. You can even substitute second-stringers for the &#34;skill&#34; positions (QB, RB, WR, TE, and FS/SS) when your starters get tired.</desc>

          <desc>It&#39;s very simple... the NFL is football and this is the only officially licensed NFL game for the NES... the closest thing to &#34;real&#34; professional football that you can play without a helmet and shoulder pads. You can select any of the American and National Conference teams, and if you&#39;re good enough, you can take them all the way to the Super Bowl! Team rosters are broken down into positions and individually rated according to skills, with position upgrade packages, player ability handicapping, actual NFL Offensive and Defensive Playbook alignments with audibles and even variable wind direction and strength. You not only coach from the sidelines, you also control all the movements of the players on the field. Run, pass, catch, kick, punt, jump, tackle, block and dive... Refs even call penalties. No matter what kind of fan you are, whether you know the rulebook inside-out or just watch an occasional game on TV... this is the one football game you&#39;ve got to have!</desc>

But Sutekh&#39;s seedy underworld is about to be infiltrated by a superhero unlike any the world has ever seen. A superhero who can melt into the darkness like a phantom. By day this brave new crimefighter is a common ordinary citizen. But when night falls, he is cloaked in a secret identity to seek out and destroy the dark forces that lurk on midnight streets. Who is this man the press calls Nightshade? Only you can answer that... for he is you! Every night you solidify your superhero status, patrolling 100 of the city&#39;s darkest corners. Here you&#39;ll find thieves, muggers, and other alley scum that you must either deal with or destroy for clues. But be warned. You&#39;re not the only night stalker. For as you hunt Sutekh, Sutekh hunts you with the human printing press, the closing wall of spikes, deadly jackal pits, and the chilling freeze ray. Of course the ultimate key to destroying Sutekh is your popularity. For it&#39;s a power source that gives you the wit to decipher clues and the strength to pulverize villains and rescue innocent bystanders. Remember, if this heroic prowess ever diminishes, you&#39;ll no longer control the night. You&#39;ll be consumed by it.</desc>

          <desc>The game opens on a vegetative theme: siblings Maru and Cori are sent to bed early for not eating their vegetables, whereupon they drift off to sleep and dream together. Suddenly, a spaceship crashes before them! &#34;Lettuce check it out,&#34; urges Maru. From the ship appears a man dressed as a king. &#34;I yam King Kale,&#34; he says, &#34;Won&#39;t you peas peas help me?&#34; Yes, the flaccid puns start to fly from this point and don&#39;t let up until the very end of the game. Those expecting witty dialogue from this game obviously have never spoken to a game programmer before.&#xA;&#xA;It seems that King Kale needs the pair&#39;s help to prevent six worlds from being dominated by a mysterious being known as Vegetron. Every hero needs a nemesis, right? Unfortunately, despite managing to look almost evil in a cute way, Vegetron fails to come across as a threat to our heroes. One wonders how he even managed to dominate his back garden, let alone six planets, with his army of cute robots and &#34;vegetable-themed&#34; guardian minions, the latter of which are vulnerable in the same spots and which can be dispatched with almost the same pattern on each world. This is the same Vegetron who, after a single defeat at the hands of Maru, realizes the error of his ways and chooses to turn over a new leaf in a platitudinous soliloquy which goes on and on. That puts an end to Veggie&#39;s chances of reappearing in sequels without some kind of contrived plot twist.&#xA;&#xA;Our two heroes, then, set off on an adventure to save the kings imprisoned by the boss guardians on each of the six worlds. This being a platform game, each world has its own theme and pitfalls that need to be dealt with. These include the anti-gravity of the Space Fortress, fire pits of the Hot Pepper Planet, black holes of the Star-Spngled [sic] Squash, and requisite icy madness of the Frozen Vegetable Section. There is also a seventh world where the final battle with Vegetron takes place.</desc>

          <desc>Nobunaga&#39;s Ambition II is the sequel to Nobunaga&#39;s Ambition. The setting is 16th century feudal Japan, a period when ruthless daimyo (feudal lords) contended with each other for dominance. Ultimately, the winner in this struggle will become Shogun and hold actual power over the islands, while being nominally subject to the Emperor.&#xA;&#xA;The game casts the player as one of the daimyo, allowing them freedom to decide the fate and future of feudal Japan, through diplomacy and ultimately war. The objective is to unify Japan under the player&#39;s rule. If the player fails through death on the battlefield, assassination at the hands of a ninja, or through natural causes, they can choose a successor and play on. Functionally, the first job is to let prosper the fief (province) under the player&#39;s control through agricultural development and town investment.</desc>

          <desc>Imagine, if you will, a universe that holds only a small group of planets. Each planet, a barren shell waiting to be given life. Imagine further, that within this universe there exists the forces of good and evil.&#xA;Having only a single Starbase to work from, you set out in ships of your own design and use them to colonize the barren planets. Strategies are needed to meet the many challenges you will face as you strive to become a great leader. Farms need to be established to feed your growing populous. Taxes have to be imposed to raise money to build a stunning array of equipment... from a spy satellite to a hydroponic planet.&#xA;Even while you are establishing that delicate balance called life, a fiendish dictator is gazing at the whole universe with greedy eyes. He schemes to conquer and control. Confrontation is inevitable!</desc>

          <desc>Paperboy 2 is a sequel to the video game Paperboy.  Much like the original the player controls a paperboy (or papergirl) who must navigate a bizarre series of obstacles while trying to deliver the morning paper to various customers on a street (though unlike its predecessor, papers had to be delivered to houses on both sides of the street). Like the original, the game is renowned for its difficulty.</desc>

When Mark regained his sight, a mysterious creature was standing before him. The creature told an eerie tale about his home planet, the Dark World, where evil monsters were terrorizing the helpless population. He was searching the galaxy for a warrior capable of freeing them from their terrible plight. The creature explained that Mark&#39;s bat was the perfect weapon for defeating the evil monsters. Mark considered the creature&#39;s proposal for a minute, then agreed to undertake the dangerous mission. After all, he thought, it sure beats going to school!</desc>

          <desc>The excitement of one of the America&#39;s most popular party games comes to the NES with Pictionary. Not only are the elements of the board game there, but so are several picture-based mini-games. Additionally, this version can be played solo, whereas the board game requires at least three people. &#xA;&#xA;The basic objective of Pictionary is for a person on a team to try and illustrate a word he or she has been given using only drawings. The team must guess what is being illustrated within a certain amount of time. As a reward for guessing the puzzle correctly, the team gets to advance on a board. The team that makes it to the end of the board first wins. &#xA;&#xA;In addition to the classic drawing aspect to the game, there are also four mini-games to be played in order for a team to win. These include &#34;Attack of the Paint Zombies&#34; (similar to Space Invaders), &#34;The Warehouse Shuffle&#34; (moving crates from one side of a warehouse to another as gremlins try to steal them), &#34;Four Alarm Rescue&#34; (catching people as they jump out of windows), and &#34;Leapin&#39; Energy Casules!&#34; (capturing energy balls to fuel your spaceship). &#xA;&#xA;There are also other game modes that enable you to use cards you may have for an actual Pictionary board game or a practice mode enabling you to simply draw.</desc>

          <desc>Don&#39;t let the name fool you - Pinball Quest is much more than video pinball. In fact, it&#39;s the first-ever multi-screen fantasy in a pinball format! Every move you make tells a story; every shot takes you another step closer in your quest to rescue the captive princess of the castle. Along the way you&#39;ll meet ghosts, goblins, witches and demons, in an endless labyrinth of treacherous passages and deadly doorways. It takes a fearless heart and a fast mind to conquer Pinball Quest. It also takes the skills of a true pinball wizard... which you can hone on the three other video pinball games included on this cartridge! So before you pour any more money into your NES library, get the one title that&#39;s a library all by itself! No matter how hard you try, you can&#39;t get enough of Pinball Quest!</desc>

          <desc>Don&#39;t let the name fool you - Pinball Quest is much more than video pinball. In fact, it&#39;s the first-ever multi-screen fantasy in a pinball format! Every move you make tells a story; every shot takes you another step closer in your quest to rescue the captive princess of the castle. Along the way you&#39;ll meet ghosts, goblins, witches and demons, in an endless labyrinth of treacherous passages and deadly doorways. It takes a fearless heart and a fast mind to conquer Pinball Quest. It also takes the skills of a true pinball wizard... which you can hone on the three other video pinball games included on this cartridge! So before you pour any more money into your NES library, get the one title that&#39;s a library all by itself! No matter how hard you try, you can&#39;t get enough of Pinball Quest!</desc>

All you have to do is build them into a pipeline that&#39;s no more complicated than the average oil refinery.  But that&#39;s the easy part.  Seconds after you put the first pipe in place, this sticky, slimey stuff called flooz starts flowing through it.  From that point on, it&#39;s you against the flooz.  But you&#39;ve got four powerful weapons.  Your right hand.  Your left hand.  Your brain.  And your left brain.  So what are your chances of out-smarting the flooz?  Nobody knows for sure.  But at last count, there were 14,567,984,176 ways to dream up a better pipeline.</desc>

          <desc>No other baseball game gets you closer to playing in the big time than R.B.I. Baseball. Because every one of the ten teams in R.B.I. Baseball contains the rosters and player stats officially licensed from the MLB Players Association. Like real baseball, these skills and stats affect the outcome of every play. Like a real manager, you&#39;ll need to make good use of this vital information - and wise strategy decisions - if you want a winning record. R.B.I. Baseball is so intensely realistic, we&#39;ve added amusing animation and a touch of humor to keep the action light-hearted and fun. You can play against the computer in a nine game season or compete against a friend in your own best-of-seven series. Stop playing with no-names and step up to the plate with real superstars in R.B.I. Baseball!</desc>

          <desc>Rackets &amp; Rivals is a typical tennis game in which the player controls an athlete on the court. A variety of actions like volley or lob can be performed by pressing buttons with the correct timing in relation to the ball movement. Besides a tournament with several matches against more and more experienced opponents and the training mode, the player can also participate in a free match. Here the match parameters can be set beforehand, e.g. the court surface or the number of sets (one or best of three). One special feature is that the player can complain to the referee.</desc>

          <desc>Radia Senki: Reimmeihen (   ?, lit. &#34;Chronicle of the Radia War&#34;) is an Action RPG for the Nintendo Family Computer created by Tecmo, and released in Japan on November 15, 1991. Though an English release was at one point planned, it was never released outside of Japan, with only a prototype ever made. There is a fan translation patch available for this game which allows the game to be played in English.[2]&#xA;&#xA;Radia Senki follows a cast of characters trying to stop the domination of Lemuria by Gadiss, a political leader. The main protagonist suffers from amnesia at the beginning of the game, but he does regain his memories by the conclusion of the story.&#xA;&#xA;The game was directed by Hideo Yoshizawa, who also worked on Ninja Gaiden while at Tecmo, and later the Klonoa series for Namco.</desc>

Coyote and you&#39;ve got one wild-goose chase that&#39;s fun, fast and exciting!&#xA;He may not be too bright, but he is hungry. And he&#39;s got his rocket, jet skates, pogo stick and helicopter.&#xA;Better get cookin&#39; before you get cooked.</desc>

          <desc>The object of the game is to complete all 50 rallies without running out of fuel. There is no limit to how many vehicles a player can receive to complete a rally, as long as they have fuel. However, the destruction of the vehicle will subtract a small amount from the player&#39;s fuel tank. In the arcade, Genesis and Lynx versions, players could start the game at a higher rally, with additional opportunities to jump several levels from time to time. Players can continue their game from where they left off, however the player has only one chance to complete the 50th and final rally. For completing the final rally the player gets one million points as bonus.</desc>

          <desc>England is in turmoil! While King Richard the Lion-Hearted is off fighting the Crusades in Jerusalem, the relentlessly greedy Sheriff of Nottingham rises to power by running roughshod over the poor folk of Britain. Now you are Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, the only man with enough cunning, agility and courage to combat the Sheriff and his evil witch, Mortianna. First, you must battle cutthroat guards and escape the Saracen dungeon where you, your friend, Peter Dubois, and your new companion, the mysterious, but loyal, Azeem, are held prisoners of the Crusades. Back in England, you&#39;ll explore the treacherous Sherwood Forest where you&#39;ll muster your band: Little John, Friar Tuck and Will Scarlett. But remember, they will only follow you if you prove yourself worthy enough to lead them, rescue the lovely Maid Marian and free England from tyranny.</desc>

          <desc>California, 1938. It had been one heck of a week for ace air racer and stunt pilot Cliff Secord, a week that had drastically changed his life. After his stunt plane was wrecked accidentally in a shootout between a couple of thugs and G-Men, the hoods had stashed an amazing stolen device in his cockpit. It didn&#39;t take long to figure out it was a rocketpack. And it took even less time for Cliff to become a target for half the city. The hoods wanted the stolen device back. So did its inventor, the famous, but eccentric American industrialist, not to mention the FBI, the U.S. Army, and the most menacing force of all, the Nazis! Even famous film star Neville Sinclair wanted the rocketpack. He had kidnapped Cliff&#39;s girlfriend, the gorgeous Jenny Blake, and was offering to exchange her for the device. Cliff had no time to ponder his desperate situation. There was only one course of action; he must become THE ROCKETEER!</desc>

          <desc>Join one of the most dominant pitchers in baseball history for Roger Clemens&#39; MVP Baseball. While the game does not come with the license of Major League Baseball or the MLBPA, there are still 26 similar teams with rosters resembling those of their actual MLB counterparts, including 1991 statistics. Though player names could not be used, the fictional ones make it apparent who each player represents. For instance, you can strike out one of Oakland&#39;s Bash brothers (M. Bash or J. Bash) with Texas&#39; R. Nolan or hit a home run with Detroit&#39;s C. Fieldman off of Chicago&#39;s M. Gaddox. &#xA;&#xA;The gameplay of Roger Clemens differs from that of most NES baseball games. Though the batting scenes may resemble those typified by R.B.I. Baseball and Major League Baseball, the view switches to what one might see from the outfield stands once the ball is hit. This results in different controls from most baseball games as well.&#xA;&#xA;A player can challenge a friend or the computer, and one-player games may be exhibition or part of a 33-game season, complete with playoffs once the season is complete. In order to help make your season a successful one, Roger Clemens himself is there to offer advice.</desc>

With their greedy eyes on RollerGames&#39; mega prize money, they&#39;ve corrupted three teams and kidnapped Emerson &#34;Skeeter&#34; Bankhead, the games&#39; beloved commissioner. You and your own three teams of righteous skate kings must stop V.I.P.E.R.&#39;s criminal venom from infecting the entire city. So you&#39;ve got to take the fight to the streets. And the sewers, and the junkyards, and the highways and the jungles... through 6 stages of dastardly traps of doom as you leap over open manholes, careening oil drums and treacherous landslides. Race around oil slicks and man-eating canines. And avoid ambush by combat copters, bomb-wielding goons and creeps like Captain Meat Hook and the Fish Face. But time is against you. And so are V.I.P.E.R.&#39;s judo masters, skateboard thugs, motorcycle madmen and other assorted sinister scum. If your multi-faceted fists can&#39;t punch you through, you&#39;ll need your special assault body blocks, jump kicks and double-whammy slams. It&#39;s a bone-crunching skate-athon for your life, Skeeter&#39;s life, and for the good of RollerGames. So vanquish V.I.P.E.R. before they melt your ball-bearings into bullets!</desc>

          <name>Saint Seiya - Ougon Densetsu (Japan)</name>
          <desc>Saint Seiya: Ougon Densetsu is an RPG based around the anime and manga series known as Saint Seiya. It was developed and published by Bandai in 1987 for the Famicom.&#xA;&#xA;The story of the game draws heavily from the first story arc of the series, from the beginning of the story to the fight with the Gold Saints. The game remains faithful to the original story while introducing some original elements. When the game came out, the story line was in the middle of the Gold Saints story arc. As a result, the last boss of the game is an original character. The actual final fight of the Gold Saints arc was carried over into this game&#39;s sequel, Saint Seiya: Ougon Densetsu Kanketsu Hen.&#xA;&#xA;The gameplay mixes side scrolling action scenes to transport the character from place to place where he may have to jump over obstacles and fight basic enemies, with a turn based combat system against bosses and other significant battles. In order to be successful at these turn based battles, the player must distribute his power, or Cosmos, to various attributes before each attack. Failure to do so typically results in no damage dealt to the opponent, and a lot of damage received. When Life is lost, the main character can be revived, but if all Cosmos is lost, then the game is over.</desc>

          <desc>Saint Seiya: Ougon Densetsu Kanketsu Hen  is an RPG based around the anime and manga series known as Saint Seiya. It was developed and published by Bandai in 1988 for the Famicom. It is the sequel to the first Famicom Saint Seiya game, Saint Seiya: Ougon Densetsu.&#xA;&#xA;As with the original game, the story draws heavily from the first story arc of the series. This version picks up where the original left off, with the Bronze Saints about to take on all twelve of the Gold Saints in order to save Saori before time runs out. The game remains faithful to the original story, to the extent that your options are limited if you try to choose match ups that didn&#39;t occur in the show.&#xA;&#xA;The gameplay mixes side scrolling action scenes where a saint must survive long enough to reach a particular Gold Saint&#39;s temple, with a turn based combat system against the Gold Saints. In order to be successful at these turn based battles, the player must distribute a pool of Seven Senses to a Saints Life and Cosmos. When Life is lost, certain Saints can be revived under certain conditions, but many are taken out of play. Other Saints and characters become available at particular points along the story.</desc>

And to crush him you&#39;ve gotta soar through his guts, blast past his death traps and ultimately blow out his heart. Good luck, Commander. The galaxy&#39;s counting on you!</desc>

          <desc>The player&#39;s force consists of nine different types of units and one headquarters unit (which is a unit by itself and also can be used to attack). Each scenario gives a different set number of units to use, which the player can mix and match between the different typese without going over that limit. When in a one-player game, the second controller can be used to modify the CPU forces. When playing against the CPU, the computer will be given a different ratio of units to command than the player. On the easiest scenario both the player and the CPU have the same amount of units, on all others the CPU will have more than the player. There is no variance in artificial intelligence, so the only thing that makes the later maps harder is the larger number of units the CPU has. The game is turn-based with no time limit. The object of the game is to destroy the enemy&#39;s headquarters unit. The player that does so first wins. Units have different mobility range, which varies according to the unit type and (except for aircraft) the terrain. They also have different shooting range, though this is fixed and not depends of the terrain. All unit types have limited ammunition and fuel. In order to replenish them the player must land them at the appropiate buildings; for example, all aircraft must stop at an airport in order to recharge their fuel and ammo supply. A certain unit is particularly strong or weak against a particular opponent, performing average against every other unit types.</desc>

          <desc>Sesame Street: Big Bird&#39;s Hide and Speak is a game for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was one of the simplest-to-play NES games ever released commercially. This game stars Big Bird and co-stars Little Bird, and features Bert, Ernie, The Count, Grover, and Elmo. This game was developed by RSP Inc. and published by Hi Tech Expressions. All 4 sides of the D-pad move little bird to the next window clockwise; A and B Buttons both choose a window. The center buttons (Start and Select) exit to the game select screen. The game&#39;s objective was to choose the correct character or letter, with six different levels. The first two levels are based on simply choosing the window instructed by Big Bird, while the next two needed memorizing since the windows close. In the fifth level the player had to spell the three-letter word instructed by choosing the right letters and the last level the player must attempt to spell the most number of different words before a time limit, the letters in the windows changing after a new word is created.</desc>

Children are asked to match simple shapes and colors and to choose specific shapes to form things like rocket ships, wheelbarrows, and birds. Astro-Grover features five different outer space-themed games that help teach children simple arithmetic. Children can add, count and subtract little green aliens called &#34;Zips.&#34; When a child gets an answer wrong, he or she is gently informed and allowed to try again.</desc>

          <desc>Shadow of the Ninja can be played by up to two players simultaneously, with one player controlling Hayate (the male ninja) and the other as Kaede (the female ninja). In either mode, the player can decide which character they want to control before the game actually begins. There are no actual performance differences between either character.&#xA;The player character can run, crouch, climb ladders, attack, and jump like in most side-scrolling action games as well as hang onto an overhang and move under it. If the player has more than half of their vitality remaining, they can perform a special attack by holding a button for an extended period, summononing a thunderstorm that will damage all on-screen enemies, but at the cost of roughly half of their maximum vitality.&#xA;The player&#39;s default weapon is a katana, which can be traded for a kusarigama and vice-versa. The kusarigama has a longer range than the katana and can be swung upwards diagonally and horizontally. However, the kusarigama can only damage enemies from a specific distance and does not work as well at close range like the katana. If the player picks up a weapon they already have, its attack power will be strengthen by an increment of one level (with up to three attack levels). However, if the player takes too much damage, their weapon&#39;s strength will be reduced back to its previous level. There is also the possibility to use both weapons, if the player starts with the kusarigama and collects secret powerups hidden in some levels (for example in the central wheel of level 1.3). The player can also obtain shurikens and hand grenades as well, both which can only be used as long the player&#39;s supply lasts before the player reverts back to using the katana or kusarigama. All four weapons are obtained by destroying item boxes scattered throughout each stage, along with vitality potions. Something worth mentioning is the fact that the potions being offered in order to heal yourself if played by 2 players will have different colors, which depending if the color of the potion is the same as the character that use it, it will replenish a large amount of health but if the color of the potion is not the same it will heal less.&#xA;The game consists of five stages, with the first four stages being divided into three segments and the final stage into two. The player will fight numerous types of enemy characters throughout each stage, including bosses and sub-bosses. once a boss has been defeated it will explode, this explosion will heal players the closer they are from it, since actually the same amount of health from one stage will be carried to the next one until either recovered with potions or by dying. The game ends if the player loses all of their vitality and only five chances are provided to continue. If two players are playing the game, their continues will be shared.</desc>

          <desc>In Shockwave you need to retrieve powerful crystals left behind by the Tarian race. The Rastons are after the crystals also, which places a short time limit on the mission. You are armed only with a spacesuit and a shockwave pistol. To retrieve the crystals, you will need to find your way through numerous mazes. Blocks in the maze can be moved with the shockwave pistol. When you hit a block with the pistol, this will move blocks adjacent to the block hit rather than the block itself. If numerous blocks are lined up, the shockwave will continue to travel through the blocks until the path is clear and a block can be moved. Some blocks are indestructable and immovable, while others can be moved, and some completely destroyed. Teleportation doors, force fields and other special items can be found in some mazes. To complete most of the levels the blocks will need to be moved about in the proper order to avoid leaving a critical path permanently blocked. If you do get stuck, there is an option to restart a maze (this feature becomes more and more useful as the game progresses.) Wandering about many of the levels are FireStars which will weaken your spacesuit and eventually destroy it. Each level has a time limit in which to solve the maze and retrieve all of the crystals.</desc>

          <desc>The aim is to shoot the discs on the screen so that you can acquire enough points to pass the clearing point score of that particular stage without your time or energy running out. You can choose between different difficulty levels. They affect the time you have to complete the stages. For difficulty level 1 you get 300 game time, difficulty level 2 gives you 250 and the 3rd difficulty level only 200. Items you can shoot during the game include an hourglass which extends time by 50, an E which gives you 100 points + 1 Energy bar, an E in a white square which gives you 100 points + 2 Energy bars, a Reverse E which gives you 1 Energy bar and C or W symbol which both give only 100 points each. Each disc you shoot above an enemy is worth between 100-500 points. The game contains three stages that involve a western, ghost house, and a space theme. There is also a bonus stage where you try to shoot as many bottles as possible. In the party game mode, you compete to have the highest score.</desc>

          <desc>Silkworm is a classic horizontally-scrolling shoot-em-up based on the 1988 Tecmo arcade game. The main difference between this game and many other side-scrolling shoot-em-ups is that you got to be on land as well as in the air.&#xA;&#xA;Player 1 would play as a helicopter, but if a second player joined the game, they would play as a jeep. Both players would have to protect each other as well as themselves. After a certain number of kills, a &#34;goose&#34; helicopter would form on the screen. If the players managed to destroy it they would get a weapons powerup. This would go on throughout the entire game (a &#34;goose&#34; could appear even during the end of level baddie!).</desc>

          <desc>The Silver Surfer roams throughout space as herald to Galactus, looking for new planets for him to feed on. However his mission is interrupted by a summon from Galactus. Silver Surfer learns that creatures from the Magick Dimension are trying to break through into the universe and their coming will end all life. Vowing to stop them, Silver Surfer must assemble the pieces of a mysterious Cosmic Device and use it to push them back. The pieces of the Device are currently in the hands of some malicious creatures: Reptyl, Mephisto, Skrull Emperor, Possessor and Firelord. Silver Surfer must travel to their domains and defeat them in order to obtain pieces of the device.&#xA;&#xA;Silver Surfer is a shooter game, with some levels taking place vertically and some horizontally. The Surfer&#39;s only ability is to move around on the screen and to shoot directly in front of him. Power-ups that can be picked up include: the letter &#34;F&#34; (Firepower) which will increase the number and power of his projectiles, Smart bombs which destroy everything on the screen, the letter &#34;S&#34; (Speedup) which increases the surfer&#39;s movement and Orbs which will also fire the Surfer&#39;s weapon. Orbs are special in that two can be obtained (only 1 is shown on horizontal scrolling levels) and they can be positioned to fire forwards, backwards or sideways.</desc>

          <desc>You are the legendary Red Baron, flying a plane through a horizontal side-scrolling scenery set during World War I. To complete a mission, you simply need to get to the landing spot on the other side without being shot down, but you can gain extra points by destroying enemy vehicles and planes. For huge points, pick up a bomb hidden in the level (you will be warned by a sound when approaching it) and drop it on a large structure. If you fail to land on the landing strip, you run out of fuel and crash.&#xA;&#xA;You can only shoot horizontally and diagonally by tilting the plane&#39;s nose. When in trouble, perform an aerial loop with the secondary button, this often destroys other planes and avoids bullets. There is a co-op mode with the character Max as well.</desc>

          <desc>Sky Shark is a top-down shooter similar to Raiden. You start off with four lives and three bombs. With that (you can get more lives at certain point intervals, and more bombs can be found), you, the &#34;Sky Shark&#34; of your squadron, blast through five levels of enemy-infested battlefields with as many as six gun upgrades. (Aside from the bombs and the gun upgrade, there are no other weapons to be found at all.) Includes three difficulty levels and two-player support.</desc>

Events include boot throwing (similar to hammer throwing), pizza balancing, and sack racing, among others. In the background, landmarks unique to Italy are shown (i.e., Leaning Tower of Pisa) and the structures using Roman architecture (i.e., the Colosseum) are shown while the player competes at the six events. A majority of the game seems to be ported from the Commodore 64 video game Alternative World Games by Gremlin Interactive.</desc>

          <desc>Solomon&#39;s Key is a platform game with both action and strategy elements. On each level your goal is to retrieve a key which can then be used to unlock the exit. To help out, you have a magic wand which can be used to create and destroy blocks (though some blocks can&#39;t be destroyed). In order to reach the key you will need carefully to arrange the blocks on the screen so you can jump your way around safely. Wandering around each level are a variety of enemies which will cause you to lose a life if you&#39;re caught. Some creatures can be killed by destroying the block they are standing on, others must be dodged. Hidden bonuses and magic can be found on many of the levels, sometimes even hidden in blocks. Some treasures give you bonus points, others can form magic spells to help deal with the enemies. To make the game more difficult, each level has a time limit in which it must be completed.</desc>

Techniques ranges from basic punches and kicks, to more elaborate maneuvers like hair grabbing moves or elbow punches. When playing with another player, one can assist the other by grabbing their partner&#39;s opponent from behind. The player begins the game with a certain number of extra lives and a life gauge which depletes as the player takes hits from enemies. If the life gauge runs out or the time limit reaches zero, the player will lose a life.&#xA;There is a small variety of enemy characters that the player will face thorough the course of the game. Certain enemies will carry a melee weapon which the player can use by disarming the enemy carrying it and then retrieving the item from the floor. The available weapons includes steel bats, whips, throwing knives, and dynamite sticks, as well as large objects such as cardboard boxes, oil drums, and rocks, which the player can lift and throw at enemies or kick it towards incoming ones.&#xA;The game is divided into four different stages or &#34;missions&#34;, which consist of a city slum, a factory, the woods, and the hideout of the boss. The game normally ends if a single player defeats the final boss alone. However, if two players manage to complete the game together then the two will be forced to fight each other in order to determine who will win Marian&#39;s affections.</desc>

          <desc>The object of this video game is to successfully launch and fly one of NASA&#39;s historic Space Shuttles. Gameplay is composed of several different types of missions, each broken up into short mini-games.&#xA;The first part of the game requires the player to activate oxygen and hydrogen pumps as well as get additional crew members into the shuttle within a strict time limit by moving an elevator up and down and avoiding moving bumpers. Then, the player must successfully launch the shuttle into space by performing quick time events that correspond to particular shuttle launch maneuvers such as booster rocket separation. Once in space, one of several missions will be played where the player must control the astronaut by maneuvering him around hazards, replenish his air supply before the timer runs out, and deliver components for the International Space Station to their correct locations. A cosmonaut from the Soviet Union must also be rescued in the game.&#xA;Finally, the player must land the shuttle by again performing Quick Time Events that correspond to landing maneuvers before finally landing at Edwards Air Force Base.</desc>

          <desc>Spartan X 2 ( Suparutan Ekusu Ts?) is a 1991 beat &#39;em up video game developed by Tamtex and published by Irem exclusively in Japan for the Family Computer. It is a sequel to Irem&#39;s 1984 coin-operated video game Spartan X (released internationally by Data East under the title of Kung-Fu Master), which was later ported to the Family Computer by Nintendo in 1985.&#xA;&#xA;The city has been corrupted by drugs for some time. Johnny Thomas, a man who lost his mother and sister as a result of his father being used as an experiment for a new kind of drug, is the only man who opposes the drug syndicates. After the incident, Thomas left the corrupted police department he was working for and became a private secret agent in order to investigate the illegal trafficking routes in his city. During his investigation, he learns that an international criminal organization known as &#34;Hawk&#34; is responsible for the majority of the drugs that has sneaked into the country.</desc>

          <desc>The game opens on a vegetative theme: siblings Maru and Cori are sent to bed early for not eating their vegetables, whereupon they drift off to sleep and dream together. Suddenly, a spaceship crashes before them! &#34;Lettuce check it out,&#34; urges Maru. From the ship appears a man dressed as a king. &#34;I yam King Kale,&#34; he says, &#34;Won&#39;t you peas peas help me?&#34; Yes, the flaccid puns start to fly from this point and don&#39;t let up until the very end of the game. Those expecting witty dialogue from this game obviously have never spoken to a game programmer before.&#xA;&#xA;It seems that King Kale needs the pair&#39;s help to prevent six worlds from being dominated by a mysterious being known as Vegetron. Every hero needs a nemesis, right? Unfortunately, despite managing to look almost evil in a cute way, Vegetron fails to come across as a threat to our heroes. One wonders how he even managed to dominate his back garden, let alone six planets, with his army of cute robots and &#34;vegetable-themed&#34; guardian minions, the latter of which are vulnerable in the same spots and which can be dispatched with almost the same pattern on each world. This is the same Vegetron who, after a single defeat at the hands of Maru, realizes the error of his ways and chooses to turn over a new leaf in a platitudinous soliloquy which goes on and on. That puts an end to Veggie&#39;s chances of reappearing in sequels without some kind of contrived plot twist.&#xA;&#xA;Our two heroes, then, set off on an adventure to save the kings imprisoned by the boss guardians on each of the six worlds. This being a platform game, each world has its own theme and pitfalls that need to be dealt with. These include the anti-gravity of the Space Fortress, fire pits of the Hot Pepper Planet, black holes of the Star-Spngled [sic] Squash, and requisite icy madness of the Frozen Vegetable Section. There is also a seventh world where the final battle with Vegetron takes place.</desc>

          <desc>The video game takes place in the &#34;deepest and darkest&#34; part of Africa during the year 1871. Nations were sending their explorers to uncover the last remaining continent that was not fully mapped by the European superpowers. Dr. Livingston abandoned his original quest to uncover the temple of Am-Zutuk; who was worshipped as a god amongst the indigenous African people. The player, as reporter Henry Morton Stanley (after Sir Stanley, 1841-1904), is exploring the last of the mysterious jungle regions for European colonization when his professor, Dr. Livingston (patterned after Dr. David Livingstone, with an ending &#34;e&#34;), gets kidnapped by some African tribesmen. Now, the player must explore one of the last uncharted parts of Africa to save his mentor and end an era of exploring Africa. The player is automatically equipped with an gyrocopter to make those tricky landings much smoother.</desc>

          <desc>Star Voyager&#39;s gameplay requires the player to venture through various sectors of the galaxy in search of different alien fleets so they can be defeated. Fuel stations are placed around sporadically and help if fuel is running low. There are several different planets that are either empty or have people that can upgrade the player&#39;s equipment to fight off the enemy fleets. These upgrades include the super laser, improved shields, and engines that enhance the ship&#39;s warping ability. Warping is a vital part of the gameplay. If players do not warp to different sectors wisely, they might end up lost, run into dangerous sectors such as the black hole or the asteroid field, or run out of fuel. The game ends if enemy ships destroy the CosmoStation Noah.</desc>

He has become a scientist and has developed a powerful medicine together with his friend Troy. But an unknown fiend breaks into his laboratory, kills Troy, and steals the invention. It&#39;s time to recall the good old days and to embark on a quest for revenge!&#xA;&#xA;Despite the US title, the game has little to do with the Street Fighter or the Final Fight games. This is an action platformer in which the player navigates Ken around, trying to avoid or kill the enemies by shooting at them with ranged weapons, adjusting the direction of the shot, or kicking and punching them. Ken is very agile and can jump high and climb walls.</desc>

          <desc>Sunman is an unreleased action video game developed by EIM and planned to be published by Sunsoft for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992. Despite being mostly complete, it was never commercially released. Also, unlike most video games of this time, it was never even announced. Most cancelled games saw months&#39; worth of publicity in video game magazines before fading off the game-watch radars. The gameplay is very similar to Sunsoft&#39;s Batman games, Batman and Batman: Return of the Joker, in that the character can run, jump, punch and duck, although in this game the player can also fly simply by pushing up. There are also some side scrolling flying levels where you can shoot laser/heat vision from your eyes. The game is divided into five scenes with one-four areas with a boss at the end of each area.</desc>

          <desc>After losing a confrontation against Super Commandos Mad Dog and Scorpion, the juices of destruction drip from the spiked tongue of the vile alien warmonger - Red Falcon. Now, he&#39;s coming back stronger than ever, with a sinister plan that includes having his intergalactic warriors seep into the brains of the U.S. Army. To support his disguised forces of doom, he&#39;s recruited Jagger Froid, a demented alien from the Black Hole Galaxy. He&#39;s also shuttled in The Babula Destructoid Mechanism with its Beam of Death. With torrential terror about to rain down upon civilization, Earth&#39;s only hope rests with you, Scorpion, and your pal, the Dogster. And if your spread guns, lasers, flame throwers and mega shells fail to destroy Red Falcon&#39;s eight levels of terror, including radioactive lava fields, it&#39;s all over but for the shouting, the screaming and the cries from a disintegrating world!</desc>

          <desc>2 in 1 game. Super Spike V&#39;Ball / Nintendo World Cup was a pack-in game included with the Nintendo Entertainment System Sports Set. The package included a standard NES console, four game controllers, and the Four Score Multiplayer Adapter. The cart included two games developed by Technos: # Super Spike V&#39;Ball, a two-on-two beach volleyball game where you played on a tournament, ending with the world championship. The game supported up to four players on one match at a time; # Nintendo World Cup, a soccer game where you (and a friend) chose to represent a team and played several matches until you won the World Cup. The game featured little to no rules, which means that you could hit your opponents as much as you want, without fear of the Ref getting in the way. Both games were compatible with the included Four Score NES multiplayer adapter.</desc>

Occasionally wrenches will appear in the roadway, and when collected they can be used after a race to power up your car with better tires, better acceleration or a higher top speed.</desc>

          <desc>Super Team Games is a side scrolling game where two players compete in races on an obstacle course. The game utilizes the Nintendo Power Pad; to control your on screen character you will need to run in place on the Power Pad to make your character run, and actually jump to make him jump. In the basic game you need to run and jump your way to the finish line as fast as possible. Some additional game variations are available, such as the belly bump ball (you need to roll a giant ball through the obstacle course by running into it), the crab walk (make it to the finish line walking like a crab!), the water cross (water is found on the track; if you mistime your jump and land in the water you need to swim to get out costing you valuable time), the bubble run (racing through the course inside a giant bubble), or the skateboard race. Several cooperative games are included as well, including a tug of war, relay race, and six legged race.</desc>

          <desc>The lost colony of Alterra is a completely man-made lifeworld abandoned long ago in a nearby galaxy. Alterra is actually five colonies in one. Each self-contained habitat has been separately bio-engineered by a powerful ecosystem generation network known as a Multiple Organism Unit Link. MORGUL, for short. Early colonists used MORGUL to render Alterra inhabitable. But a cataclysmic quake severed all system interface functions, and MORGUL murderously rebelled. The few colonists lucky enough to escape told a grim tale of a higher intelligence gone berserk.&#xA;&#xA;For generations, mankind sought a return to Alterra. Finally, genetic science created a saviour: Turrican, a mutant warrior, bio-engineered for the task of planetary reclamation. In the meantime, MORGUL has diligently twisted Alterran life forms to his brutal, destructive purposes. Thus, Turrican&#39;s challenges consist in eliminating hostile organisms from Alterra&#39;s five multi-level worlds and, finally, destroying the three faces of MORGUL.</desc>

          <desc>Sunman is an unreleased action video game developed by EIM and planned to be published by Sunsoft for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992. Despite being mostly complete, it was never commercially released. Also, unlike most video games of this time, it was never even announced. Most cancelled games saw months&#39; worth of publicity in video game magazines before fading off the game-watch radars. The gameplay is very similar to Sunsoft&#39;s Batman games, Batman and Batman: Return of the Joker, in that the character can run, jump, punch and duck, although in this game the player can also fly simply by pushing up. There are also some side scrolling flying levels where you can shoot laser/heat vision from your eyes. The game is divided into five scenes with one-four areas with a boss at the end of each area.</desc>

          <desc>Shoot some hoops with Ultimate Basketball. All of the traditional rules of basketball apply as you take control of a fictional team from one of seven American locales. Each team has its own full roster of players as well as unique strengths and weaknesses. For example, Houston has a tight defense and can shoot the three, while Dallas excels at the passing game.&#xA;&#xA;The point of view is horizontal for the most part. Occasionally, you will get a close-up action scene on plays such as slam dunks and free throws. There are also two different play modes, &#34;Tournament&#34; and &#34;One Game.&#34; You can play by yourself, against a friend, or with a friend against the computer.</desc>

There is a world map, you can choose items before starting a level, the levels themselves are quite short (unlike Adventure Island, where each large level contained several stages).  You perform standard &#34;adventure island&#34; activities: ride various types of dinosaurs, throw boomerangs at snails, birds, snakes and skulls, collect grapes and apples, jump over stones and, of course, ride your old trusty skateboard.</desc>

          <desc>Adventure Island IV is a Famicom exclusive video game (i.e.: It was never released in America nor Europe on the NES). It is known as the last official video game ever to be released on the console - almost four years after the Super Famicom was initially released and 11 years after the Famicom was released.&#xA;&#xA;The game, while still a sidescroller, is wildly different from the three previous games that were released on the console. It is more inline with games such as Metroid, as it&#39;s less of a platformer and more of an action-adventure video game. The next game in the series, Super Adventure Island II, was very similar to this title. Currently, English speaking fans of the series can play the game via a translated patch.</desc>

Leonardo&#39;s weapon are the Katana Blades, which makes it easy to strike far and fast. Raphael carries a Sai in each of his three fingered fast hands. His striking range is short but a little more powerful than Leonardo. Michaelangelo uses Nunchuks, and Donatello, a master of the Bo has some serious reach and power though he is a bit slow to strike. Unlike most games, rather than just give the plot at the beginning, here the story unravels throughout the adventure. First Shredder gets Beebop and Rocksteady to capture the Turtles friend April O&#39;Neal. Once April is rescued it turns out that Shredder has set eight bombs around the local dam. The dam though was a ploy to lure the Turtles away from their lair so that Mechaturtle, another of Shredder&#39;s minions, could kidnap Splinter.</desc>

          <desc>Yo! After being treated like garbage by the Ninja Turtles, Shredder has trained a new, more merciless breed of Foot Soldiers to inflict his revenge: A clan of over 700 Taekwondo turtle terminators who have once again captured April O&#39;Neil to use as turtle bait. Fortunately you don&#39;t have to face these freaks of torture alone. For the first time ever, two dudes or dudettes can join forces and double-team Shredder, kicking shell while covering each others tails. But to survive you&#39;ve gotta fight through 8 action-packed arcade levels, including Vinnie&#39;s Valet &#34;Stalking&#34; Lot and the Soho Sewer System, plus two new never-before-seen shell-squashing stages! Each of these deathtraps is reinforced by lethal electro zappers, laser beams, freezer burners or enemies such as Scorpion Robots, Stone Warriors and Baxter Stockman. Shredder has also hired the all-powerful Tora and Shogun, two alien bounty hunters who have never known defeat. Even though Master Splinter has prepared the turtles well for battle, teaching them radical new attack moves, it doesn&#39;t mean this war to save April and turtlekind will be a piece of cake or even a slice of pizza. Because with the forces of revenge on his side and the bounty boys in town, it&#39;s payback time for Shredder!</desc>

Leonardo&#39;s weapon are the Katana Blades, which makes it easy to strike far and fast. Raphael carries a Sai in each of his three fingered fast hands. His striking range is short but a little more powerful than Leonardo. Michaelangelo uses Nunchuks, and Donatello, a master of the Bo has some serious reach and power though he is a bit slow to strike. Unlike most games, rather than just give the plot at the beginning, here the story unravels throughout the adventure. First Shredder gets Beebop and Rocksteady to capture the Turtles friend April O&#39;Neal. Once April is rescued it turns out that Shredder has set eight bombs around the local dam. The dam though was a ploy to lure the Turtles away from their lair so that Mechaturtle, another of Shredder&#39;s minions, could kidnap Splinter.</desc>

          <name>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - Tournament Fighters (USA)</name>
          <desc>The game is very much in the tradition of the Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter series, pitting you against opponents one at a time. Some fighters (besides the turtles) will be familiar, such as the Casey Jones, or even Shredder.&#xA;&#xA;Though even people familiar with the turtles will see differences in them. They can now, for example, do moves involving projectiles, such as &#34;fireballs&#34;.&#xA;&#xA;The game&#39;s modes include a story mode, where you can only pick one of the turtles and go on fighting opponents in order to defeat the Shredder, and a tournament mode, where you fight only for the fame and money.</desc>

          <name>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II - The Arcade Game (Australia)</name>
          <desc>Yo! After being treated like garbage by the Ninja Turtles, Shredder has trained a new, more merciless breed of Foot Soldiers to inflict his revenge: A clan of over 700 Taekwondo turtle terminators who have once again captured April O&#39;Neil to use as turtle bait. Fortunately you don&#39;t have to face these freaks of torture alone. For the first time ever, two dudes or dudettes can join forces and double-team Shredder, kicking shell while covering each others tails. But to survive you&#39;ve gotta fight through 8 action-packed arcade levels, including Vinnie&#39;s Valet &#34;Stalking&#34; Lot and the Soho Sewer System, plus two new never-before-seen shell-squashing stages! Each of these deathtraps is reinforced by lethal electro zappers, laser beams, freezer burners or enemies such as Scorpion Robots, Stone Warriors and Baxter Stockman. Shredder has also hired the all-powerful Tora and Shogun, two alien bounty hunters who have never known defeat. Even though Master Splinter has prepared the turtles well for battle, teaching them radical new attack moves, it doesn&#39;t mean this war to save April and turtlekind will be a piece of cake or even a slice of pizza. Because with the forces of revenge on his side and the bounty boys in town, it&#39;s payback time for Shredder!</desc>

          <name>Terminator, The (USA, Europe)</name>
          <desc>The Terminator loosely follows the plot of the 1984 Arnold Schwarzenegger film. The game begins in the future, where the hero Kyle Reese must battle through a post-apocalyptic future in order to go back in time to 1984 Los Angeles. Once there, he must progress through various checkpoints as outlined by the main movie plot: Find Sarah Connor, shootout at the police station, and the climax in the factory. The main levels of the game consist of side-scrolling jumping and shooting action. In between levels are car chases where the Terminator attempts to run you down as you race to your next destination.</desc>

          <desc>In the follow-up to Moon Cresta, a well-guarded planet is being invaded. You will have to make a succession of passes over the landscape, shooting out ground turrets and aliens. Numbered bases release power-ups when shot - these can either be used in combination or (by pressing the space bar) in Formation Mode, covering a wider range of shooting positions. Each pass over the planet ends with a boss; the third and final one with a boss who can only be killed if you are at maximum power. Death puts you back to the start of the world.</desc>

          <desc>A random sequence of tetrominoes (sometimes called &#34;tetrads&#34; in older versions)shapes composed of four square blocks eachfall down the playing field (a rectangular vertical shaft, called the &#34;well&#34; or &#34;matrix&#34;). The objective of the game is to manipulate these tetrominoes, by moving each one sideways and rotating it by 90 degree units, with the aim of creating a horizontal line of blocks without gaps. When such a line is created, it disappears, and any block above the deleted line will fall. With every ten lines that are cleared, the game enters a new level. As the game progresses, each level causes the tetrominoes to fall faster, and the game ends when the stack of tetrominoes reaches the top of the playing field and no new tetrominoes are able to enter. In certain versions, the game can also end if the player is able to get all the way to level 15.&#xA;&#xA;All of the tetrominoes are capable of single and double clears. I, J, and L are able to clear triples. Only the I tetromino has the capacity to clear four lines simultaneously, and this is referred to as a &#34;tetris&#34;. (This may vary depending on the rotation and compensation rules of each specific Tetris implementation. For instance, in the Super Rotation System used in most recent implementations, called &#34;Easy Spin&#34; in Tetris Worlds, certain rare situations allow T, S and Z to &#39;snap&#39; into tight spots and clear triples.)</desc>

          <desc>In Tiles Of Fate the object of the game is to clear the screen of all the tiles within the given time limit. This is done by selecting two tiles with matching symbols which will cause them to disappear due to the force of symmetry. However, the force of symmetry can only make two right angles at most, and can not pass through other tiles. To clear all the tiles, you will need to plan your moves carefully. To help out, you may discover one of three forces of fate under a tile which can be saved and used when you&#39;re stuck. The forces are The Flash of Chance (allows symmetry to affect any matching tiles on the board, even those surrounded by other tiles), The Force of Balance (will eliminate brick walls that block the path of symmetry) and The Flag of Knowledge (this will make your next move for you in case you can&#39;t spot what the best move is.) Also included is a level editor which lets you create your own tile challenges.</desc>

          <desc>In the year 2050 the Earth has been attacked by the villainous Raggosians and it is your job to save the planet! You will need to pilot your ship, The Tempest, to the planets Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, and Earth in order to retrieve certain minerals which can be used to fight the Raggosians. The Raggosians will be trying to stop you from reaching these destinations, though, so you need to use the Nintendo zapper to fight back. Numerous (and very fast!) enemy ships will fly by on the screen and attempt to destroy your ship. You need to shoot the ships and incoming missiles before your ship takes too much damage. From time to time a comet will fly by, and if you shoot this a temporary barrier will be formed that protects your ship from enemy fire. Occasionally you can also earn a smart bomb which appears in the bottom of the screen and destroys all enemies if shot. Each level ends with a large boss which will take multiple hits to destroy.</desc>

          <desc>Toki, known in Japan as JuJu Densetsu (JuJu?) is a 1989 shoot &#39;em up platformer arcade game, or a &#34;run and gun&#34; developed and published in Japan by TAD Corporation and published in North America by Fabtek. It features elements of tongue-in-cheek humor combined with the action. The player takes control of an enchanted ape who must battle hordes of jungle monsters with energy balls from his mouth (described humorously as &#34;monkey-spit&#34; or &#34;monkey-vomit&#34; by some gamers). The ultimate goal is to destroy the evil wizard who cast a spell on you; therefore transforming yourself from an ape back into a human, and rescuing the kidnapped princess. The game was ported to several video game consoles and home computers.</desc>

You rotate your tyre left or right, and drift as the current sends you, making sure to avoid the banks of the river, and the dividing lines in the middle. Hazards include crocodiles, stray logs and branches, and fishermen - you are armed with a limited supply of tin cans to take care of these. There are gates to slide through on the way down - these give you a points bonus. Each level has a strict time limit to adhere to, although there&#39;s a kickin&#39; party at the end if you succeed.</desc>

A collection of police, soldiers, and creatures will try to stop him. Quaid&#39;s default attack is a strong punch, though guns can be knocked away from some guards and picked up for use. Cutscenes between certain levels tell the movie&#39;s plot, and feature likenesses of the actors from the film (including Arnold).</desc>

Unlike the various PC iterations, this title was created by Interplay and published by Acclaim.&#xA;&#xA;Players control Doug Quaid as he platform hops across Earth and Mars in search of his stolen memories and the responsible parties. A collection of police, soldiers, and creatures will try to stop him. Quaid&#39;s default attack is a strong punch, though guns can be knocked away from some guards and picked up for use. Cutscenes between certain levels tell the movie&#39;s plot, and feature likenesses of the actors from the film (including Arnold).</desc>

          <desc>In Amagon, your mission is to investigate a dangerous, monster-infested island. As Amagon, you begin the game with only a machine gun and a limited amount of ammo to protect yourself from the inhabitants of the island. Gameplay is an arcade style platform game with six levels, each with a variety of creatures and a large boss at the end. When you destroy an enemy, a power up will sometimes be left behind. Collecting these can give you extra points, an extra life, more ammo, or a mega key. If you have enough points and collect a mega key, you then have the ability to transform into Megagon. In this form, you are larger in size, can jump further, and have increased strength. You start the transformation with an amount of mega points; each time a creature injures you, points are lost. When all of the mega points are gone you will transform back into your normal size.</desc>

          <desc>Radia Senki: Reimmeihen (   ?, lit. &#34;Chronicle of the Radia War&#34;) is an Action RPG for the Nintendo Family Computer created by Tecmo, and released in Japan on November 15, 1991. Though an English release was at one point planned, it was never released outside of Japan, with only a prototype ever made. There is a fan translation patch available for this game which allows the game to be played in English.[2]&#xA;&#xA;Radia Senki follows a cast of characters trying to stop the domination of Lemuria by Gadiss, a political leader. The main protagonist suffers from amnesia at the beginning of the game, but he does regain his memories by the conclusion of the story.&#xA;&#xA;The game was directed by Hideo Yoshizawa, who also worked on Ninja Gaiden while at Tecmo, and later the Klonoa series for Namco.</desc>

          <desc>In this puzzle game, the player controls one of the trolls as they bounce back and forth across the screen trying to acquire the jewels on the playfield. The one caveat is that the players troll has to match the color of the jewel he or she is trying to collect. To become the correct color to snatch up the jewels, the player has to bounce across a paint can that will change your trolls hair to that of the same color as the paint can. The object in each puzzle is to retrieve all the treasures in a room without their character falling prey to the various enemies in rooms or running out of time.</desc>

Lord British, the country&#39;s benevolent monarch, has disappeared, and a man named Blackthorn has usurped his throne. The tyrant rules the land by enforcing the virtues upon the will of the people, corrupting their meaning in the process. His fundamentalist visions led him to create a police state, where failure to adhere to the virtues is punishable by death. Behind Blackthorn are the three Shadowlords, anti-thesis to the three principles of Truth, Love, and Courage. The Avatar must understand their meaning and origins, find a way to defeat them, rescue Lord British, and restore the former ethical principles of Britannia.</desc>

          <desc>Shoot some hoops with Ultimate Basketball. All of the traditional rules of basketball apply as you take control of a fictional team from one of seven American locales. Each team has its own full roster of players as well as unique strengths and weaknesses. For example, Houston has a tight defense and can shoot the three, while Dallas excels at the passing game.&#xA;&#xA;The point of view is horizontal for the most part. Occasionally, you will get a close-up action scene on plays such as slam dunks and free throws. There are also two different play modes, &#34;Tournament&#34; and &#34;One Game.&#34; You can play by yourself, against a friend, or with a friend against the computer.</desc>

When you&#39;ve managed to get your opponent&#39;s stamina points down to zero, you&#39;ve won the round. A round can also be won by pushing your opponent off of the screen. Also, if time runs out the losing fighter will be taken away by a cop car, or a player can lose by falling into an open manhole. A match has been won after you&#39;ve defeated your opponent three times. After winning, you will be declared the Urban Champion.</desc>

Each level contains energy stars, which can be traded in for upgrades such as improved weapons and extra speed after each level.</desc>

          <desc>Wheel of Fortune: Family Edition is one of a series of NES games based on the famous TV game show. The goal is to solve a word puzzle by guessing letters. The players take turns spinning a wheel that has designated money amounts in most spaces, but can also bankrupt the player in the wheel lands on the wrong space. A player can guess a letter and if that letter is in the puzzle, those spaces are flipped to reveal the letter and the player earns the cash amount specified by the wheel spin, multiplied by the number of occurrences of the letter. Only English consonants can be guessed-- the 5 English vowels can be purchased using a player&#39;s earnings.</desc>

Your job is to search the city for clues, items and punchlines to jokes which will be your only defense should the Weasels catch up to poor Roger. Except for these Weasels (and birds flying overhead), Roger is more or less invincible as a toon. That means for most of the gameplay, he will be ignored. Should the Weasels appear in an area with you however (with an alarm sounding as they get close), Roger will go bug-eyed and try to run away. It is then up to Eddie to keep the Weasels away from Roger or engage in knock-knock jokes should they happen to catch him.</desc>

          <desc>Dragon Warrior uses console role-playing game mechanics which were described by Kurt Kalata of Gamasutra as archaic in 2008. The player takes the role of a namable Hero. The Hero&#39;s name has an effect on his statistical growth over the course of the game. Battles are fought in a turn-based format and experience points and gold are awarded after every battle, allowing the Hero to level-up in ability and allows them to buy better weapons, armor, and items. Progression consists of traveling over an overworld map and through dungeons, fighting monsters encountered via random battles along the journey.</desc>

If there is a chain of monsters within two yoshi egg shells, the egg shells will merge and a Yoshi will form, adding points and eliminating a group of monsters. The larger the chain of monsters between the two eggshells, the larger the Yoshi that is created will be.</desc>

In this game, a young Indiana Jones embarks on globetrotting adventures in which he gathers treasure and fights for what is good and right.&#xA;&#xA;The game features side-scrolling action where young Indy trots along the ground, jumps, crawls flat, and can collect and wield a variety of weapons against the many enemies in the game. Indy starts with a whip and can find such weapons as throwing knives, grenades, pistols, rifles, and others. He can also collect hat power-ups which allow him to sustain more damage.</desc>

          <name>Ys (Japan)</name>
          <desc>The player controls Adol on a game field viewed from a top-down perspective. As he travels on the main field and explores dungeons, he encounters numerous roaming enemies, which he must battle in order to progress.&#xA;&#xA;Combat in Ys is rather different from other RPGs at the time, which either had turn-based battles or a manually activated sword. Ys instead features a battle system where Adol automatically attacks when walking into enemies off-center. When the protagonist moves toward his enemy, damage is sustained on both sides. Attacking straight on causes the attacker the most damage to himself, but clipping the edge of the defender yields a successful differential. This combat system was created with accessibility in mind. This &#39;bump attack&#39; system has become one of the series&#39; defining features. Falcom staff have compared this style of gameplay to the enjoyment of popping air bubble sheets, in the sense that it took the tedious task of level-grinding and turned it into something similar to a high-score-based arcade game. According to GamesTM and John Szczepaniak (of Retro Gamer and The Escapist), &#34;Repetition of the act was pleasurable as you developed a psychological rhythm and, even in the event of backtracking, progress was always swift since the player never needed to stop moving.&#34;&#xA;&#xA;Another feature that has been used in nearly every Ys title since the original is the recharging health mechanism, which had previously been used in the Dragon Slayer (to which Ys is the official successor) clone Hydlide series, although Hydlide itself borrowed the feature from the 1980 game Rogue (video game) in the first place. Recharging health has since become a common mechanism used in many video games today.</desc>

          <desc>The player controls Adol as he battles his way across the land of Ys. As in the first game, Adol&#39;s strength is measured in a typical RPG fashion: He has numerical statistics such as HP, Attack Power, and Defense Power that determine his strength. These stats are increased by raising his experience level through battling.&#xA;&#xA;Also returning from the first game is the &#39;bump&#39; combat system. The player attacks enemies by running into them, and the enemy takes damage according to Adol&#39;s Attack Power. A new addition to Ys II is the Magic system: Adol can acquire several different spells he can use throughout the course of play, such as a Fire spell for attack, and a Time spell which can stop enemies as long as it is active. The use of magic consumes Adol&#39;s MP stat.</desc>

Auto-attack is removed; the player must push a button to make Adol attack enemies. As in previous entries, however, neither the player character nor the enemies have temporary invincibility.&#xA;&#xA;Otherwise, the gameplay mechanics are identical to previous entries in the series. The statistics, equipment, shopping, experience system, and magic all function the same as in Ys I and II (though spells are represented by rings instead of wand icons, and MP is renamed &#34;Ring Power&#34;).</desc>

Furthermore, should a zombie hostage fall out a window he can rescue them to slowly power up his attacks. Enemies reduce health by varying amounts; health can be restored by increasing the player&#39;s score. The game features four distinct stages with two difficulty settings.</desc>
