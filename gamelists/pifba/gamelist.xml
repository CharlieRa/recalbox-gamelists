          <name>1941: Counter Attack (World 900227) </name>
          <desc>1941 Counter Attack is a vertical shooter by Capcom and conversion of the arcade game of the same name originally released in 1990. The action takes place during World War II and depicts Capcom&#39;s own fantastic vision of the historic battle between the American and Japanese air forces in the Pacific. The player&#39;s mission is rather straightforward - on board a Lockheed P-38 airplane, he must fight his way through six varied stages, take down enemy installations, battleships and other huge rockets on their narrow launching pads. Unlike its predecessors in the series, 1941 Counter Attack traded the trademark and arguably monotonous level design for a more structured and diverse formula. Stages vary from an enemy infested canyon to city landscapes and fortified strongholds. Several powerups can be collected along the way, such as tiny wingmen widening the plane&#39;s fire power, or destructive special weapons such as laser beams and side rockets. The main weapon can also be charged up by holding the fire button to discharge a powerful attack. Finally, the plane comes with a small life bar and can be hit three time before being blasted into oblivion - this bar however increases as the game progresses, and is used to release devastating special attacks as well. 1941 Counter Attack also features a two simultaneous player mode.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <desc>There is no longer conventional baseball in 2020. The Super Baseball designed by the SUPER BASEBALL ASSOCIATION has been very popular and is the best sport. However, the truth is that the association has used a colossal sum of money to promote Super Baseball as show business. They have manipulated each player&#39;s ability using the control computer to secretly decide victory or defeat in every game. The players who knew this removed the connecting parts of the computer to play their own game of baseball.&#xA;&#xA;Finally, a fair game in going to be played at &#34;CYBER EGG&#34;!&#xA;&#xA;FUTURISTIC SUPER BASEBALL, NOW PLAY BALL!&#xA;&#xA;2020 Super Baseball:&#xA;1.

The Super Baseball Association has been very profitable over the years with robotics power players up against the strongest of athletes. Due to the secret manipulation of certain robotics team players, abilities have been computer controlled to decide the outcome of certain games, benefiting the SBA. Die hard players discovered the SBA&#39;s cheating and have now disconnected several parts of the computers to achieve fair and challenging play. Now the games may continue in the famed Cyber-Egg Stadium where only power and skill will determine the winner!&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <desc>Strap yourself into the cockpit and squeeze off heat-seeking missiles in this grittily realistic jet-fighter shooter. &#xA;&#xA;Sinister forces have melted the Antarctic ice cap, flooding the earth&#39;s cities. No one knows where they came from or what they want. But when the mysterious invaders attack Tokyo, you&#39;re called to lead an elite international team of pilots into the incredibly wild blue yonder!&#xA;&#xA;In single-player mode, AeroFighters Assault features eight primary and four bonus missions. The game features four aircraft, plus two bonus fighters. Your enemies come at you in jet fighters, helicopters, submarines and frigates, guaranteeing endless wing time as you blow away aliens bent on world conquest. There are giant bosses, too! &#xA;&#xA;The action takes place over cities, oceans dotted with icebergs and parched desert. For pure flying fun, Multiplayer mode features a sky stage in which you run absolutely no risk of running into the ground. AeroFighters Assault supports full 360-degree action by allowing you to switch among multiple camera views at any time. &#xA;&#xA;The product of an unprecedented partnership between arcade specialist Video System and the flight sim masters at Paradigm Entertainment, AeroFighters expands on the traditional shooter by adding plenty of authentic touches. The Paradigm team logged plenty of wing time crafting high-tech flight sims for military pilots before helping Shigeru Miyamoto and his NCL team develop Pilotwings 64. With experience like that, AeroFighters is a first-rate flight sim, complete with a stunning flight-physics model and dazzling acrobatic moves.&#xA;&#xA;A savvy veteran of the arcade wars, Video Systems made sure to pack AeroFighters Assault with white-knuckle action, especially when you&#39;re dogfighting a buddy in two-player mode.&#xA;&#xA;Redrawing the intricately detailed fighters at supersonic speeds would tax most game systems, but the powerful N64 never misses a beat. The Controller&#39;s analog Control Stick gives you pin-point control as you bank, roll and plunge into screaming dives after your high-powered enemies.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <desc>An overhead driving / shoot&#39;em up game from Sega which borrows heavily from Bally Midway&#39;s 1983 classic, &#34;Spy Hunter&#34;. The player begins the game riding a motorbike. In subsequent levels a sportscar, a beach buggy, a boat, a chopper and even a Formula-1 racing car can all be driven. All of the vehicles are, of course, fully armed to deal with the many enemy vehicles and gun emplacements intent on stopping the player&#39;s progress. The helicopter levels play as a straightforward vertically-scrolling shoot&#39;em up and bear more than a passing resemblance to Namco&#39;s &#34;Xevious&#34;.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <desc>1-on-1 fighter featuring 8 selectable characters.&#xA;&#xA;The game&#39;s major innovation is the ability to walk into the background, in a similar manner to side-scrolling beat &#39;em ups such as &#34;Streets of Rage&#34; or &#34;Final Fight&#34; because of this, unlike many other 2-D fighting games, the game uses one action button to jump, it also does not use the &#39;D&#39; button, (Which many of SNK&#39;s other fighters did), only 2 action buttons are used for attacking (punch and kick), instead grappling and grabbing opponents (Pressing the A &amp; B buttons simultaneously) is the focus of the gameplay, opponents can counter being grabbed, as well as break free. Also featured is weapon play, again similar to beat &#39;em ups, weapons can be picked up and thrown, or used in special &amp; standard attacks. Weapons are thrown in by background crowd members who will step forward to toss them into the ring. Another (strange) innovation of the game is that characters start to sweat -graphically- after a while.&#xA;&#xA;Characters have unusually high health for the genre, with multiple, different coloured, health bars in one bar similar to a method of health bars used for boss characters in games of the time, in addition to this, each character has a &#39;Crazy Meter&#39; at the bottom of the screen, which is built up as characters attack, this gives the character a special, often very bizarre, attack that will kill the opponent outright, known as the GanGan Attack in Japan, and the Crazy Attack in the US.&#xA;&#xA;Battles are joined by irreverent, sometimes humorous pre-fight banter from characters, the dialog differs depending on whom each opponent is, and a clashing of 2 small images of the characters eyes, which clash in the center of the screen.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <name>Area 88 (Japan) </name>
          <desc>Area 88 is a side scrolling shooter by Capcom, conversion of their own arcade game originally. An evil general and his army are taking over the world and they must be stopped. A group of three highly skilled mercenary pilots who blow things up for cash, Shin Kazama, Mickey Scymon and Greg Gates, accept the mission readily. On board of their aircrafts they&#39;re now ready to defeat the greedy dictator and restore peace. One of the distinctive feature of the game is the ability given to the player to purchase new weapons and fighter planes. Right from the start, pilots are offered a F8E Crusader fighter and some cash. Then after each mission, the earned cash can be used to purchase new weapons or a brand new fighter giving the player a sense of customization. But there is a catch and special weapons and cash are lost if the player happens to die during a mission. Each pilot also comes with his own specialty - Shin, the young hero pilot, can level up the standard plane&#39;s Vulcan gun faster than his friends, Mickey, the hot-shot, can carry more special weapons and Greg, the veteran, has more health and can recover faster from injuries. The game is vast and offers not less than ten intense stages. It is however one player only.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <desc>The player takes control of a boy who must use his hammer to break the blocks that form part of the colourful, platform-strewn levels that form each stage. These holes act as traps for the many patrolling monsters and once an enemy has fallen into a hole, the player must then use the hammer on the enemy to make it fall through the hole and down to the platform below - causing it to change into fruit, which can then be collected. This game is a reworking of the 1980 classic, &#34;Space Panic&#34;.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <name>Biomechanical Toy (Ver. 1.0.1885) </name>
          <desc>Biomechanical Toy is a colourful eightway-scrolling platform game set in a world of magically animated toys. The magical pendulum that animates the toys has been stolen by the evil &#39;Scrubby&#39; - a criminal once imprisoned for trying to steal the pendulum who has managed to escape and take his revenge.&#xA;&#xA;Evil toys now patrol the kingdom and must be destroyed or avoided. Good toys have been trapped throughout the levels and if freed by Inguz, will give help by providing additional firepower for a short time.&#xA;&#xA;Inguz carries a basic, single-firing gun, although additional ammo clips can be found throughout the game that upgrade the gun with either extra shot power, automatic firing or exploding bullets. When the gun&#39;s current ammo clip is empty, Inguz will take a moment to reload, leaving him vulnerable to attack.&#xA;&#xA;Inguz begins each stage (and each new life) with a full health meter of eighty units, but food can be found that will boost the health meter. The player can lose a life either by running out of health, falling off the bottom of the screen, or running out of time. Clearing each stage awards bonus points based on both remaining time and health units.&#xA;&#xA;Checkpoints - indicated by red flags - are located at certain points throughout the stages. In the event of losing a life, the player will restart at the last checkpoint reached. Objects with Inguz&#39;s face on them (such as wooden chests and balloons) release bonus items when shot.&#xA;&#xA;An abstract, oriental-looking face occasionally forms part of a level&#39;s platform which, when shot, releases balloons which can in turn be shot for bonus items. A giant flying hat also occasionally appears and will drop bonus items when shot. Smart Bombs can also be found at certain points that, when run into by Inguz, will damage or destroy all enemy toys on screen.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <name>Blue&#39;s Journey / Raguy (ALM-001)(ALH-001) </name>
          <desc>Raguy is an environmentally-themed side-scrolling platform game for one or two players. &#xA;&#xA;The player controls a heroic young man named &#39;Blue&#39; (in the two-player game the second player controls &#39;Princess Fa&#39;, who has identical powers to Blue), whose peaceful home planet of &#39;Raguy&#39; has been invaded by the evil Daruma tribe. The Daruma are polluting the planet as they consume its dwindling resources and it falls on Blue and the Princess to stop them and save Raguy. &#xA;&#xA;Both Blue and Princess Fa have the ability to stun enemies by hitting them with a large leaf. Once stunned, they can be picked up and thrown as projectiles at other enemies. Blue and Princess Fa can also shrink in size in order to access hidden areas, but they are not able to stun enemies while shrunk. If only one player is shrunk, they can be picked up by the other player and thrown as a projectile at the enemies. &#xA;&#xA;Flowers, bonus items and power-ups are littered throughout the levels. The flowers are the game&#39;s form of currency and can be used in the shops that are located throughout the game. There are two different types of shop, offering either tips and help with overcoming certain obstacles, or health and weapon power-ups.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <desc>An adult shanghai game from Mitchell. The objective is to clear the board of matching tiles before the timer runs out.&#xA;&#xA;Each level consists a board with two or more columns of tiles and walls slowly moving toward the center of the board.  Every time a matching pair of tiles is cleared from the board the two columns momentarily shift away from the center. The game is lost if the opposing columns of tiles run into each other or into the wall. In order to legally remove matching tiles no walls or other tiles can be in a path with two or fewer bends between the matching tiles. Once per stage, the player can request help and the two columns will shift to their starting positions and matching tiles will be highlighted for a short time. If the player cannot legally remove any more tiles then the board is &#39;deadlocked&#39;, and the game is lost.&#xA;&#xA;If the player clears the board before the timer runs out, the background girl will change into a more revealing state of undress and this new image of her will be the background for the next stage.  If the timer reaches zero the player can still attempt to clear the board but the background image will not change.  The game features four girls with two background images each and a topless image that is revealed after defeating the girl&#39;s second stage within the time limit. &#xA;If the game is lost, upon continuing the player may select to attempt to clear the same board or try a new board of tiles.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <desc>Cyber-Lip is a platform shoot-em-up for one or two players that borrows heavily from Konami&#39;s &#34;Contra&#34; series. Players must battle through sideways-scrolling levels, to defeat armies of cyborgs and androids and restore order and peace to the world.&#xA;&#xA;Cyber-Lip has two shooting modes, one for standard weapon use and one for rocket launchers and grenade throwing. Players can switch between the two modes at any time, but only carry a limited amount of grenades or rockets. Weapon power-ups and additional grenades and rockets can be picked up throughout the levels.&#xA;&#xA;At the end of certain levels, the game&#39;s heroes will enter an elevator and players can then choose whether to go &#39;up&#39; or &#39;down&#39;, depending on which route through the game they wish to take. Each level has a large end-of-level boss that must be defeated.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <name>Daimakaimura (Japan) </name>
          <desc>Daimakaimura is a platform game by Capcom and is the SuperGrafx port of the classic arcade game known outside of Japan as Ghouls&#39;n Ghosts. The brave Arthur, infamous for wearing red hearted boxers under his piece of armor, is back. His beloved princess Prin-Prin has been captured by the great demon king Loki and he has now, once again, the daunting task of rescuing her. His journey gets him through six long stages from a creepy cemetery infested with Grim Reapers and Vultures, to a abandoned windmills full of deadly stone turtles. Arthur starts the game equipped with a short joust spear that he can throw at his enemies. Treasure chests appear from time to time (usually triggered by jumping over specific spots of the scenery) and Arthur can crack them open to reveal new weapons, brand new piece of armors or, if already equipped with one, the almighty Golden Armor. But treasure chests can also reveal mean sorcerers who won&#39;t hesitate to turn our hero into an elderly man with a walking stick, or a cute but particularly vulnerable duck. Finally, the Golden Armor can be charged up and unleash powerful attacks from the equipped weapon. For instance, the spear can trigger a lighting spell and daggers a mirror-image of Arthur. The game is vast and mean guardians keep the gates leading to Loki&#39;s lair.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <desc>Dai Sen Puu is a vertical shooter, conversion of Toaplan/Taito&#39;s arcade game originally released back in 1989. The player controls a World War II fighter plane and must fly deep into enemy lines and destroy formations of tanks and other warships. Small trucks sometimes appear and release bonuses when shot: P (power ups), H (extra bomb) or flashing planes (extra life). A group of six planes can also be called to fly next to our fighter and shoot anything in sight. Pressing the bomb button twice drop a powerful bomb that cleans up a fair amount of the screen. Finally, Dai Sen Puu offers an unusual feature : levels do not pause between them and uncover instead a continuous flow of undisturbed shooting action.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <name>Dynamite Dux (set 1, 8751 317-0095) </name>
          <desc>An abstract and hugely entertaining take on the classic sideways scrooling beat-em-up genre for one or two players; in which two blue and red pet ducks called &#39;Bin&#39; and &#39;Pin&#39; take on a variety of bizarre enemies - such as disembodied moose heads and mortar-using wolves - in their quest to rescue their kidnapped owner, Lucy.&#xA;&#xA;The ducks have a powerful punch which can be &#39;charged-up&#39; by holding down the button, in a similar fashion to the beam weapon in Irem&#39;s &#34;R*Type&#34;. In addition, extra weapons such as rocket launchers and bombs can be picked up along the way.&#xA;&#xA;There are also two bonus stages (which appear after levels 2 and 4). In these stages player one fights against player two. The winner is awarded 100,000 points. If the time limit expires before the fight is settled, the player with the most energy is awarded 50,000 points.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <name>Dangan Feveron (Japan, Ver. 98/09/17) </name>
          <desc>A vertically scrolling shoot-em-up from the undisputed masters of the genre, &#39;Cave&#39;, Dangun Feveron features the usual Cave trademarks of intuitive, power-up driven gameplay backed-up with superb graphics and sound.&#xA;&#xA;Dangun Feveron features a very high level of player customisation. At the start of a new game, players are prompted to select 3 different ship attributes; the speed of ship they wish to pilot (from a choice of four), which of the 3 rapid-fire weapons they prefer, and their preferred choice of sustained-fire weapons (activated by holding down the FIRE button). This allows players to tailor the ship to suit their individual needs and gameplay styles, be it a fast-flying speeder with widespread shots to handle enemy squadrons, or a ship with a lower speed that makes it easier to negotiate the swathes of enemy bullets that often fill the screen.&#xA;&#xA;Another of the game&#39;s selling points is the capture-and-score system. Initially, every enemy destroyed is worth only one point. However, whenever an enemy is destroyed, coloured spheres appear in its wake, each containing a trapped, human prisoner. The spheres can then be collected by the player to earn additional points. For each prisoner saved, the total points gained from each enemy killed increases by one. For example, saving 56 prisoners means every subsequent defeated enemy is worth fifty-seven points. When the spheres appear, they drift slowly towards the bottom of the screen, before moving back up towards the top where, if they are not collected in time, they drift out of the screen and beyond the player&#39;s reach. This resets enemy-destroyed score back to a single point per enemy. If the player loses all of their lives and chooses to &#39;Continue&#39; the game, the rescue count is reset to zero.&#xA;&#xA;Dangun Feveron&#39;s final distinction was in its use of music and sound effects, with the game&#39;s creators drawing heavily on the disco sound of the 1970s.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <desc>Final Fight is a side scrolling beat&#39;m up and is the conversion by Capcom of their own arcade game originally released in 1989. The game features two playable characters - the heavy built but slow former champion wrestler Mike Haggar and the more agile and fast martial art expert Joe Cody. Here is the first difference that would strike players used to the arcade game - the third character from the original game, Guy, is nowhere to be seen. The Mad Gears gang has taken over Metro city and has kidnapped the daughter of the newly elected mayor, Mike Haggar. Jessica also happens to be Cody&#39;s girlfriend and our two heroes must fight their way through the city, beat-up dozens and dozens of vile gang members and finally take down the evil Belger, their murderous leader. Levels are built around locked-in sections, in which all opponents must be defeated to continue. The game also includes several bonus stages such as a fun car-breaking exercise with an iron pipe. Each fighter can use simple fighting moves such as punches, jumps and pressing punch rapidly triggers powerful combos. They can also grab and throw, or hold on and hit their enemies. Finally, each fighter comes with a special attack when punch and jump are pressed simultaneously - this move drains some of their health energy but allows them to safely escape desperate situations. This Super Famicom port is a cut-down version of the original arcade game, the two players mode is gone as well as the fourth factory/Industrial stage.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <desc>Jessica, the daughter of the city Mayor Mike Haggar has been kidnapped by the evil &#39;Mad Gear&#39; gang. Set in the fictional Metro City, Haggar rounds up two of his closest friends, Guy and Cody, and sets out to battle Mad Gear&#39;s gang members and ultimately rescue his daughter.&#xA;&#xA;1 or 2 players choose to play as either Guy, Cody or Haggar in this superb, sideways scrolling beat-em-up. As well as the standard punch and kick moves, each character also has a special attack. This move is powerful enough to fell several enemies at once, but with the trade-off that each time a special attack is executed, some of the player&#39;s energy is lost. Energy levels can be replenished by finding the food that lies hidden in certain crates and barrels. Some of the Mad Gear gang members will drop a weapon when they are felled. These weapons can then be picked up and used by the players.&#xA;&#xA;After the benchmark-setting &#34;Double Dragon&#34;, released by Technos in 1987, Final Fight would become the standard-bearer of the scrolling beat-em-up genre. Featuring a large variety of distinctive, well animated characters moving through colorful and detailed backgrounds, and with a control system that is as intuitive as it is complex, Final Fight is still considered to be the finest example of its kind.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <desc>A 1 or 2-player scrolling beat-em-up, with players selecting a character from a choice of 5; in which 2 &#39;Elemental Warriors&#39; must battle Satan and his army of demons that have captured and taken over the world. Each player-character possesses either Wind strength, Fire strength, or a mix of the 2.&#xA;&#xA;Gaia Crusaders is heavily influenced by another scrolling beat-em-up, Capcom&#39;s 1989 classic, &#34;Final Fight&#34;, and also, to a lesser degree, by Sega&#39;s legendary &#34;Golden Axe&#34;, also from 1989. The latter is particularly evident in the use of the Magical Attack, which acts as a smart bomb and is also identical to the magic attacks featured in &#39;Golden Axe&#39;.&#xA;&#xA;Gaia Crusader&#39;s superb combo-geared control layout allows players to produce some highly impressive moves and attacks.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <desc>Gals Panic! is a &#34;Qix&#34;-style adult puzzle game.  The objective is to reveal 80% of the silhouetted girl&#39;s image within the time limit while avoiding the enemies.&#xA;&#xA;To complicate things, there is a bar with a pointer at the top of the screen. If the pointer dips below a certain level (indicated by the change in color) the image will change to that of a monster. The pointer slowly creeps towards the monster side of the bar over time and whenever the player reveals a significant piece of the silhouette.  Revealing the un-silhouetted part of the image moves the pointer back towards the girl side of the bar.  If a round is completed while the monster&#39;s image is shown then the round must be repeated.&#xA;&#xA;After every round there is a roulette game where the player can earn rewards or penalties that will take effect in the following round.&#xA;&#xA;After winning three rounds against a girl, the graphic becomes a photographic image of that girl.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <name>Golden Axe (set 6, US, 8751 317-123A) </name>
          <desc>Golden Axe is a side scrolling beat&#39;em up by Telenet and conversion of Sega&#39;s popular arcade game. The evil lord Death Adder has come to threaten the peaceful land of Yuria. He now holds the king and his daughter captive in his castle, as well as the legendary Golden Axe which he intends to destroy if the people of Yuria don&#39;t crown him as the ruler of the country. Three warriors (also on a promise of personal revenge) set out on a long journey to defeat Death Adder and his motley army of mercenaries and undead monsters. Each fighter comes with a signature weapon and fighting techniques: Ax Battler is a muscular barbarian wielding a two-handed heavy sword, Tyris Flare is the only female of the group and carries a long-sword and Gilius Thunderhead is a dwarf armed with a sleek double axe. Each hero can also summon elementals to the party&#39;s aid - Ax posses the powers of the Earth, Tyris the powers of the Fire and Gilius the powers of the Lightning - and the more magic potions they collect and use, the more destructive the magic spells become. Another unique twist of Golden Axe is the ability given to the players to ride beasts, as long as their original owner can adequately be knocked off their ride first. All the rideable beasts come with special attacks, some use simple tail whips whereas others can breathe jets of fire. Golden Axe consists of eight stages but is single-player only.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

There are secret items and food to be found on each level that increases the player&#39;s power and score. The power-ups themselves consist of a shield, helmet lasers, speed and jump shoes. Players will face a boss encounter every ten stages and the game ends after the 30th stage.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <desc>A horizontally scrolling fighting game for 1 to 4 players. Each playable character (chosen from Mark, Glen, Akira and Gil) kicks and punches their way through a number of enemy-packed levels. In addition to kicking and punching, each character also has their own unique &#39;special attack&#39;; a move that injures multiple on-screen enemies at the cost of some of the player&#39;s health.&#xA;&#xA;While in no way original (drawing most of its inspiration from Capcom&#39;s &#34;Final Fight&#34;), Karate Blazers is both hugely playable and very fast and frenetic, with the amount of on-screen enemies at times overwhelming. The graphics are also well drawn and nicely animated.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <desc>The quest to defeat the mysterious Baron of Battlers, the mysterious &#34;K&#34;, is on. In order to get to this grotesque gladiator, you need to fight your way through 13 with the most skilled, most deadly of all combatants in the world of physical contact. Use your powers of pulverization, psychic energy blasts, and ridiculous strength to become the explosive fighting god in FIGHTER&#39;S HISTORY DYNAMITE!!!&#xA;&#xA;Don&#39;t just participate in history, MAKE IT! The sequel of the first &#34;Fighter&#39;s History&#34;, this time ported in the Neo Geo MVS Hardware. In this new version of the original game several changes and improvements were made to enhance the gameplay: now the battles are faster and more technical, with the usual friendly combo system that makes the fight so spectacular. There are also some powerful hidden moves added for most of the characters. Even the graphic was slightly enhanced, with a nice color palette and some wonderful backgrounds (especially Zazie&#39;s).&#xA;&#xA;The game actually suffered from the reputation to be a &#39;SFII clone&#39; given by the general opinion from the first episode. Thanks to this new chapter of the saga, which was particularly appreciated by the Neo Geo fans because it is one of the rare &#39;SFII style&#39; beat&#39;em ups on the Neo Geo this changed.&#xA;&#xA;A really nice and classical beat&#39;em up, still worthy to be played, especially for the real fans of the 2-D beat&#39;em up.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <name>The King of Dragons (Japan 910805, B-Board 90629B-3) </name>
          <desc>The King Of Dragons is a side scrolling Beat &#39;em up and is one of Capcom&#39;s long series of side-scrolling beat&#39; em ups that flooded the arcades back in the 1990s. This title is however rather unusual and takes place in a fantasy world populated with beefy warriors and evil dragons. The world is devastated by a red and ferocious dragon and the game spreads along no less than fifteen stages. Five playable characters are available from the start : the strong warrior, the cleric, the magical wizard, the light elf and the heavy dwarf. Obviously, each character has its own strengths and weaknesses and they can receive various upgrades throughout the game in the shape of new weapons, shields or new staffs. They can also level-up and consequently increase their life bars. Heroic fantasy games wouldn&#39;t be complete without magic, and magic there is - simple lightning bolt attacks can be triggered by any player and can damage several enemies at once. It is interesting to notice that a two simultaneous player option is available.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <name>League Bowling (NGM-019)(NGH-019) </name>
          <desc>A colourful and playable ten-pin bowling game for 1 to 4 players, offering a choice of three scoring methods : &#39;Regulation&#39;, &#39;Flash&#39; and &#39;Strike 90&#39;.&#xA;&#xA;The game begins with players selecting either a right or left-handed bowler, before choosing what weight they want their bowling balls to be. Once the match starts properly, Power and Direction meters will appear and players must use both their judgement and timing to select and execute the desired bowl. Timing is key as players are only allowed twenty seconds to make each shot.&#xA;&#xA;The &#39;Strike 90&#39; mode awards players ninety points for a strike and sixty points for a spare. In the &#39;Flash&#39; game mode, the points flash across the lane as the players throw the ball. Should they succeed in knocking down the standing pins, the points that are displayed at the time the pins are struck will be added to the players&#39; scores.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <name>Magician Lord (NGM-005) </name>
          <desc>Magician Lord is a side-scrolling platform shoot-em-up in which players take on the roll of a wizard called Elta - the last Magician Lord - on his quest to save his homeland from the evil Gul-Agieze, who plans to resurrect the God of Destruction using 8 tomes of mystical power.&#xA;&#xA;Elta has to jump, shoot and climb his way to the end of each of the game&#39;s 8 levels where he must beat a servant of Gal, along with one of Gal&#39;s sinister boss creations. To complete the game Elta must reach the final stage and defeat Az Atorse himself. If the player takes too long to complete a stage, Elta will be harassed by an invincible monster.&#xA;&#xA;Elta&#39;s primary form of attack is a weak but fast-moving energy projectile that can fired in one of four directions, but by collecting the special coloured orbs that ocassionally appear, he can transform into a different form, making him more powerful and giving him new attacks.&#xA;&#xA;These are the six different forms that Elta can assume by picking up the colored orbs:&#xA;&#xA;* Dragon Warrior: In this form Elta attacks by breathing fire; a continuous short-range attack that, unlike the standad attack, can also be aimed diagonally.&#xA;&#xA;* Waterman: The Waterman-form attacks with water grenades  blue bubbles of water that burst upon touching the ground and form into water pillars. The attack can hit several times for additional damage but only covers a small area.&#xA;&#xA;* Poseidon: A more powerful version of the Waterman, Poseidon shoots wide waves of water that travel along the ground for several hits. It does severe damage and causes enemies to freeze and shatter on impact. While very powerful, this form moves very slowly.&#xA;&#xA;* Shinobi: The Shinobi-form gains increased agility and attacks with powerful magical arcs of fire which are wide but slow-moving.&#xA;&#xA;* Samurai: While limited in range, the Samurai-form is the only form that can attack through walls, shields or even multiple enemies, using a boomerang-like energy attack that does heavy damage.&#xA;&#xA;* Raijin: The Raijin-form gives Elta&#39;s jumping ability a big boost as well as a unique attack that creates a continuous electrical field around his body.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <name>Muscle Bomber: The Body Explosion (Japan 930713) </name>
          <desc>A 1-on-1 fighting game in which players choose from 10 different wrestlers and take to the ring to try and defeat their larger-than-life opponents. Each wrestler has an assortment of moves, including his own special &#39;super slam&#39;. The object of the game is to win and defend the championship by pinning or putting a submission hold on your opponent.&#xA;&#xA;There are 2 different game modes to select and play : Single Match or Tag Team &#39;Battle Royal&#39;. In Single Match, players choose to be one of eight wrestlers including &#39;Mike Hagger&#39;, &#39;Alexander The Grater&#39;, &#39;El Stingray&#39;, &#39;King Rasta Mon&#39;, &#39;Titanic Tim&#39;, &#39;Gunloc&#39;, &#39;Biff Bolshevik&#39; and &#39;The Great Oni&#39; (&#39;Jumbo Jack&#39; and &#39;The Scorpion&#39; cannot be selected in this game).&#xA;&#xA;Once a wrestler has been selected, players will compete in a world-wide tournament against the other 9 wrestlers (including &#39;Jumbo Jack&#39; and &#39;The Scorpion&#39;) in respective matches. In each match, players must defeat each of their respective opponents by a pinfall, count-out or submission in order to proceed to each of the following matches. Once all opponents are defeated, the winner will be crowned champion and players will have to face all opponents again to defend their title.&#xA;&#xA;In Tag Team &#39;Battle Royal&#39;, players can choose to play as any 2 of the 10 wrestlers for their tag team, including &#39;Jumbo Jack&#39; and &#39;The Scorpion&#39;. Here, the player and his or her partner have to eliminate both of the 2 wrestlers on the opposing tag team, in order to win the match and proceed to the next. During these matches, if the player is eliminated before his or her partner is, the match will be declared no contest and it will be a draw.&#xA;&#xA;During each bout in this game, metal buckets and/or glass bottles will sometimes be thrown into the ring which can be picked by the players&#39; wrestler(s) and used as weapons against their opponents.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <name>Mighty! Pang (Japan 001011) </name>
          <desc>Mighty! Pang is the fourth game in the superb Pang series. While the artistic design has been drastically changed, Mighty! Pang retains the same gameplay of its predecessors. The game features three modes of play: panic, tour and expert modes.&#xA;&#xA;Tour mode is the standard mode of play featuring 57 stages. The player goes on a tour of the world, popping balloons and picking up power-ups. Each location on the tour features a number of stages which feature a new background of a famous tourist attraction. Each stage is cleared by popping all of the balloons within that stage.&#xA;&#xA;Expert mode is a mode for advanced players.  Play is broken up into stages like in tour mode but the stages are much more difficult.&#xA;&#xA;Panic mode is a basic one-stage mode of play where new balloons continuously fall from the sky. The single stage is a basic one with no platforms or barriers. Some of the smallest balloons will flash and shooting these balloons will pause all of the balloons in place for a short duration of time.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <desc>A research installation developing the next-generation of Metal Slugs is attacked by unknown forces and a disk containing Metal Slug secrets is stolen. Ordered to recover the disk, Marco and Tarma follow in hot pursuit. Meanwhile, Eri and Fio, investigating the Ptolemaic Army, a paramilitary syndicate active in archeological excavation, catch up with them at an ancient ruin, &#39;The Corridor of Fire&#39;. The two try to storm and seize the site but are repulsed by the natives and giant Metal Slugs. This incident proves it was the Ptolemaic Army that stole the Metal Slug secrets. The military subsequently launches a second raid by the elite PF squad and Sparrows on the &#39;The Corridor of Fire&#39; to recover the secrets and destroy the syndicate!!!&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <desc>The heroes of Metal Slug, Marco and Tarma, are called into action once again to take on the might of General Morden and his armies in this, the first of several sequels to the superb 1996 original. This time, however, Morden has acquired a number of powerful allies to aid him in his evil schemes, some of which are not even human. The 2 brave soldiers are called upon to deal with this threat once again, aided by members of the newly founded &#39;Sparrow Squad&#39;, Fio and Eri.&#xA;&#xA;Metal Slug 2 improved on much of what made the first game great; featuring more enemies, larger bosses, more weapons, more vehicles, more hostages, more surprises and more humour than its illustrious predecessor. The occasional moments of slowdown that blighted the first game are still present, however.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <name>Metal Slug 3 (NGM-2560) </name>
          <desc>The heroes of the first 2 games return once more to do battle with the ever-present General Morden and his vast army. The third game of the series places a greater emphasis on defeating hulking boss characters than the 2 previous outings. Metal Slug 3 also introduced multiple routes through most levels, vastly increasing the replay value of the game. For example; on the first level the player reaches a point where they can either continue over land, or enter a small submarine and head down into the ocean depths, where they will be faced with a variety of huge, deadly sea-dwelling creatures.&#xA;&#xA;Metal Slug 3 introduced a number of new elements that have a direct effect on the player&#39;s character - similar to the &#39;mummification&#39; of the second game. The first of these is the &#39;fatty&#39; affect : should the player pick up too much food (fish, for example) their character will morph in an obese version of itself. This doesn&#39;t have any detrimental effect on performance and is included purely for reasons of humour. Another effect is the now infamous &#39;Zombiefication&#39;; should the player&#39;s character be attacked by a Zombie, he or she will become Zombie until they are either killed, or pick up a first-aid, which will restore the player&#39;s character back to human form. Movement while in the zombie state is slow and restricted but the player is armed with what can perhaps be best described as the &#39;Zombie Vomit&#39;; a huge arc of blood that can be used to destroy oncoming enemies. A second Zombie attack while the player&#39;s character is in a Zombie state will result in the player losing a life.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <desc>The popular series of side-scrolling action games continues, introducing all-new characters into the plot. The world is now trembling under the fear of cyber terror, as the birth of a deadly new computer virus threatens to snatch the main military system out of every country. The virus has been created by the terrorist group known as Amadeus, and must be stopped by the four main heroes in the story. They are : Marco Rossi, an army platoon leader; Fio Germi, a superior director of an Italian secret service; Nadia Cassel, a French regular army soldier; and Trevor Spacey, a regular army sergeant. In the game introduction, the team discover that Morden is still alive and probably behind Amadeus...&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <desc>A research installation developing the next-generation of Metal Slugs is attacked by unknown forces and a disk containing Metal Slug secrets is stolen. Ordered to recover the disk, Marco and Tarma follow in hot pursuit. Meanwhile, Eri and Fio, investigating the Ptolemaic Army, a paramilitary syndicate active in archeological excavation, catch up with them at an ancient ruin, &#39;The Corridor of Fire&#39;. The two try to storm and seize the site but are repulsed by the natives and giant Metal Slugs. This incident proves it was the Ptolemaic Army that stole the Metal Slug secrets. The military subsequently launches a second raid by the elite PF squad and Sparrows on the &#39;The Corridor of Fire&#39; to recover the secrets and destroy the syndicate!!!&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <name>Metal Slug X - Super Vehicle-001 (NGM-2500)(NGH-2500) </name>
          <desc>Originally released to improve upon some of the problems the previous Metal Slug game (&#34;Metal Slug 2 - Super Vehicle-001/II&#34;) had, most notably its notorious slowdown, this update also implemented several changes to beef up the gameplay, such as new enemies, a different end boss layout and a number of new weapons and secrets. The result is a better game and one of the finest chapters in this series.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <desc>The land has been cast in darkness by Drokmar, who has been corrupted by the Black Orb; an artefact that promises immortality to anyone who comes under the influence of the orb&#39;s powerful sorcery. Two warriors set out to fight their way through fifty levels of platform beat-em-up, in order to destroy the orb - which lies at the top of the Dragon Tower - and free their lands.&#xA;&#xA;Treasure chests litter the levels which, when smashed open, release treasure items, magic power-ups, keys, food and weapons. As players fight their way through the levels, they will come across a number of trapped prisoners. As long as the heroes are carrying keys, prisoners can be released who will then fight alongside the players, with each prisoner possessing their own unique attacks. Weapons and power-ups can be picked up to aid players in their quest and food can be found and eaten to increase player health.&#xA;&#xA;As the players ascend the tower, they will be granted new magical weapons after each boss they defeat. The player&#39;s weapons are affected by a &#39;magic bar&#39; that charges over time. When fully charged, the weapon has a powerful ranged attack, but when not charged only a close attack is produced. A magical staff will grant increased range attack ability. A magical blast may be generated by pressing the Attack and Jump buttons at once, but costs health.&#xA;&#xA;There are multiple paths in the game, and two separate endings. Hidden doors can be used to skip levels when found - usually by attacking a wall or a particular spot.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

Players can run and somersault to avoid the incoming enemy fire.&#xA;&#xA;A number of more powerful weapons - such as grenades and flame throwers - are often dropped by the enemy and can be picked up and used. Bonus points are also revealed in this fashion.&#xA;&#xA;Nam-1975 is a blatant plagiarism of TAD Corp&#39;s &#34;Cabal&#34;, released in September 1988. Cabal is easily the more accomplished of the two games.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

Nemo is armed with a magical staff that emits a burst of magic to destroy the many enemies, some of which require multiple hits. A number of power-ups also appear at regular intervals to aid Nemo in his quest through seven tough stages.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <desc>A cartridge-based arcade system board. The MVS stands for Multi Video System, and as its name suggest, offers owners the ability to put up to six different arcade titles into a single cabinet, a key economic consideration for operators with limited floorspace. With its games stored on self-contained cartridges, a game cabinet can be exchanged for a different game title by swapping the game&#39;s ROM-cartridge and cabinet artwork.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <desc>An adult variation - one of several released by the company - of the 1981 Taito classic, &#34;Qix&#34; (and, latterly, &#34;Gal Panic&#34; from Kaneko), in which players must &#39;colour in&#39; sections of the background in order to reveal a digitized picture of a naked woman in an erotic pose. Like &#34;Qix&#34; and its sequels, Fantasia&#39;s levels are populated with a number of enemies who must be avoided or destroyed. As well as the enemies, players are also fighting against a tight time limit.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

On both the &#39;Normal&#39; and &#39;Panic&#39; skill levels, players can choose from 4 different playable characters; each possessing different strengths and weaknesses, such as a double harpoon or quick shots. On the beginner level, players can only use the Mexican character.&#xA;&#xA;Another notable difference is in the game&#39;s use of backdrops : instead of the world landmarks of the first two games, Pang! 3 features classical works of art in the form of paintings and sculptures.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <name>Pocket Fighter (Japan 970904) </name>
          <desc>A superb, abstract and humorous fighting game featuring miniaturized renditions from several Capcom fighting games; including the legendary &#34;Street Fighter&#34; series, as well as &#34;Darkstalkers&#34; and the little-known &#34;Red Earth&#34;.&#xA;&#xA;During a bout, players will be able to release coloured gems from successful attacks against their opponent, as well as from wooden chests that regularly appear. Collecting these gems will &#39;power-up&#39; the player&#39;s character, giving them more powerful attacks. There are two bars and three sub-bars in the interface. The two main bars are the life bar and the super bar; the first indicates the player&#39;s health and the second their ability to throw super combos. The Super Bar itself can be filled up to nine levels, allowing players to execute more super combos. Each super combo has a level assigned to it, and it uses Super Bars depending on it.&#xA;&#xA;The 3 sub-bars show the level of 3 of each player&#39;s special moves. Each character has at least three special moves, as shown in the sub-bars, and each of these corresponds to a color. Some characters have one or two additional Special Moves that aren&#39;t affected by sub-bars. Each time a player shoots their opponent, gems pop out of him or her, and the attacker can take them to power up their own special moves according to the colors.&#xA;&#xA;There are 4 buttons : PUNCH, KICK, SPECIAL, and TAUNT. The Special button is a chargeable move that cannot be blocked and upon impact drops gems in the opponent&#39;s possession. More gems will be dropped depending on how much the player charges the attack. Holding Down, Forward or no direction at all when using the Special button will cause a specific gem color to drop from the enemy. Holding Back along with the Special button allows for a defense that is specific against the unblockable Special attacks. Other kinds of attacks do no damage when blocked, and unlike most 2-D fighting games, this includes special and super moves.&#xA;&#xA;Pocket Fighter also features Flash Combos in which a player can execute a combo by pressing the KICK or PUNCH button after they have hit their opponent using the PUNCH button for a total of 4 hits. Flash Combos will usually cause a player&#39;s fighter (except Ryu) to change into various costumes during the sequence, and perform a powerful attack in the end. This final hit is usually the hardest in the sequence to connect with. These costumes range from uniforms (such as traffic cops or schoolgirls), to swimsuits, and even cameos of other Capcom characters. For example, Chun-Li may turn into Jill Valentine from the Resident Evil series, while Felicia may turn into Mega Man or other Darkstalkers characters not playable in the game.&#xA;&#xA;The commands are also very easy compared to the Street Fighter series, thanks to SPECIAL button. By doing a motion (for example : qcf or hcf) and pressing the Special Button the fighter will launch his or her super combo.&#xA;&#xA;In addition to the usual punches, kicks and fireballs, each character has a couple of very abstract yet powerful &#39;special&#39; attacks; which can range from the player producing a huge mallet (Ken), to standing on a podium and motioning a bicycle race through the opposing fighter (Chun Li).&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <desc>In a time when the industrialization of the world had just begun, various inventions appeared and changed the life of the peaceful kingdom. One of them was a propeller that evolved from pure wind generation by using the created electricity to re-rotate it. It was called &#39;The Professional Gear&#39;, or just &#39;Progear&#39;. This invention was the key to conquer the great wide open sky. Another discovery made the ancient dream of the immortal body come true. But it was affordable only by some wealthy elderly. They formed a new council called &#39;the Motorouin&#39; and declared the current government as a corruptive and greedy establishment and that they want to correct it by a new educational system, in order to create a new race of man. So they built a military force to realize the first step of their plan, which was the takeover of the kingdom. The government decided to stop the aggression by putting it&#39;s own army in motion. It was a dreadful battle with many victims. But it was won by the Motorouin. This battle is mentioned in the books of history as &#39;The Punishment of the Sages&#39;.&#xA;&#xA;A group of young pilots, actually children whose families were killed in that war, finally decided to fight back. They secretly developed a new powerful weapon which adults were not able to use. They called it &#39;Gun Flyer&#39; and installed it in all of their planes. The Storm of Progear was about to begin!&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

Unfortunately Otane has now disappeared! So a new tournament is called out in order to quickly find a new clan leader. All the fighters from the first tournament have returned as well as some eager (... and strange!) newcomers. Featuring some of the funniest parodies of famous fighting games, a cool soundtrack an tons of new moves making it a way better game than its predecessor, there is no doubt that only the strongest will survive this battle!&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

Some sections also have the player&#39;s minecart leave the track entirely and travel over open ground.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <desc>Riot City is a side-scrolling beat-em-up for one or two players who take on the roles of &#39;Paul&#39; or &#39;Bobby&#39;, two talented fighters who are given the task of breaking a drug syndicate known as &#34;MID&#34;. It has also been discovered that Paul&#39;s girlfriend has been kidnapped by the syndicate and must be rescued.&#xA;&#xA;MID&#39;s hideout is located on Riot Island, an island full of abandoned, run-down buildings that has since become a slum. Locations include apartments, a hospital, a factory and a casino.&#xA;&#xA;Riot City is practically a direct copy of Capcom&#39;s superb &#39;Final Fight&#39;, with both gameplay and graphical style heavily copied from the 1989 classic. One gameplay difference is that Riot City does not allow players to pick up and use weapons as they can in Final Fight, although bonus items found in various containers can be collected.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <desc>After inserting quarters and hitting the Start button, the player chooses one of 6 planes (plus 1 hidden plane) or can opt for a random choice.&#xA;&#xA;The available fighters are :&#xA;* P-38 Lightning&#xA;* Vought XF5U &#39;Flying Pancake&#39;&#xA;* Spitfire Mk. VI&#xA;* Zero Type 52&#xA;* Focke Wulf Ta 152&#xA;* Fiat G.56&#xA;* XP-55 Ascender (Hidden) &#xA;&#xA;The first 4 stages are in random order, while the last 4 are sequential. Players collect weapon powerups, bombs, and gold bars for points. Each plane has a unique &#39;supershot&#39; which is charged by damaging enemies and fired by holding then releasing the fire button. Supershots can be stored, although the number varies from plane to plane. Using a Bomb results in a large friendly fighter swooping onto the screen and blocking shots while returning fire for a few seconds.&#xA;&#xA;After the player beats the final boss, the game starts again from the beginning, albeit at a much higher difficulty level. All level are similar to the ones in Strikers 1945 II. Only one of the 4 bosses that are randomly chosen and the 6th boss is changed.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <name>Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon (Ver. 95/03/22B, Europe) </name>
          <desc>A 1 or 2-player sideways scrolling beat-em-up sees the Sailor Senshi fighting their way through five levels of anime-based combat. Each Sailor Soldier - chosen from a selection of 5, stiletto and mini skirt-wearing combatants - can punch, kick, jump, and throw their enemies; before finally reaching the traditional end-of-level boss.&#xA;&#xA;As with Capcom&#39;s &#34;Final Fight&#34;, and indeed many other games of the genre, items that aid the player are either dropped by beaten enemies or revealed after hitting certain obstacles and containers. Food can be used to replenish lost health and various trinkets can be picked up for bonus points. Finally, magic crystals can be found and are needed to activate the &#39;special attack&#39; move. This works in a similar way to Sega&#39;s &#34;Shinobi&#34;, with every enemy on the screen taking a hit.&#xA;&#xA;Players must have at least one crystal to use the Special attack and up to 5 crystals can be carried at once. The more crystals the player holds when the special attack is utilized, the more effective it is against the game&#39;s enemies. Each level features its own unique, anime style animation. On level five, Sailor Soldier&#39;s signature attack move, from the original Japanese anime upon which the game is based, makes an appearance.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <name>Shinobi (set 4, System 16B, MC-8123B 317-0054) </name>
          <desc>Shinobi is a scrolling platform beat-em-up in which the player takes on the role of Joe Musashi, a Shinobi Ninja, who must fight his way through 5 tough missions - each made up of between 3 to 5 stages - in his quest to rescue the kidnapped Ninja children of the Iga clan; now hostages of an evil Ninja syndicate called &#34;Zeed&#34;. To complete a mission, the player must rescue all of the kidnapped children on each level, with the number of hostages remaining displayed on a meter in the bottom left corner of the screen.&#xA;&#xA;The Shinobi Ninja begins each level armed with either &#39;shuriken&#39; throwing stars or a gun for long-range attacks; and a Samurai sword for close-range combat. In addition, the Ninja also has one &#39;Magic Attack&#39; per level; a smart bomb which kills or damages all on-screen enemies. A points bonus is awarded whenever a level is completed without the Magic Attack being used. An end-of-level guardian awaits the player at the end of each mission, and each takes several hits before it is killed. Once a boss is defeated, the player is taken to a bonus stage in which a large number of Ninjas will try to &#39;jump&#39; from the back of the screen to the front to attack the player. A bonus life is awarded if the player manages to kill all of the Ninjas without being attacked.&#xA;&#xA;Shinobi was a huge success for Sega, and deservedly so. Its perfectly realized blend of platform and fighting action and is as fine an exponent of the &#39;easy to get into, difficult to master&#39; gameplay ethic as video games have seen.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <desc>More of an update than a full-blown sequel, Shock Troopers - 2nd Squad picks up where the first game - released a year earlier - left off. Once again, one or two players face the might of a terrorist army who are threatening to destroy the world by launching a newly developed weapon-of-mass-destruction if their wishes - to be given absolute control of the newly-founded nation of Billberk - aren&#39;t granted.&#xA;&#xA;Like many Neo Geo sequels, 2nd Squad doesn&#39;t particularly do anything the original didn&#39;t do. There are some improvements, however; graphics have been given a brush up and level design is a little more imaginative than that of the already impressive original.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <desc>Shock Troopers pits the players against a mighty terrorist group who are holding a girl hostage, in order to force her grandfather to surrender a powerful drug which will enable the terrorists to control the minds of the grandfather&#39;s soldiers and create a huge, unstoppable army.&#xA;&#xA;Shock Troopers is a multi-directional scrolling shoot-em-up for one or two players that builds upon the foundations laid by Capcom&#39;s 1985 classic, &#34;Commando (Capcom)&#34; and also borrows heavily from Commando&#39;s sequel, &#39;&#34;Mercs&#34;. As well as enemy troops, players must contend with tanks, choppers and assorted military vehicles, and must also be careful to avoid any of the landmines that litter the levels. Extra weapons and health can be picked up from destroyed enemy vehicles, as well as being found in enemy supply crates. Shock Troopers is effectively three games in one as players can chose one of three different routes; each made up of different levels. The game also offers greater variety of gameplay than other of the genre; with levels having the players travel on the back of fast moving vehicles, climbing a rock face etc.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <name>Solomon no Kagi (Japan) </name>
          <desc>A superb and addictive platform/puzzle game in which a single player controls a wizard called &#39;Dana&#39;, whose quest is to retrieve &#34;Solomon&#39;s key&#34; and vanquish the demon hordes that have broken through into the world. To achieve this Dana must advance through the fifty rooms of &#39;Constellation Space&#39;, before finally reaching the magical key.&#xA;&#xA;Each room has a key that Dana must collect. Once collected, the room&#39;s exit will open and the wizard must then try to find and/or create a safe route past the constantly spawning demons to reach the exit and progress to the next room. To enable him to do this, Dana is armed with a magic wand that can be used to both destroy and create granite blocks to use as platforms and barriers. Dana can remove existing blocks with his wand, and can remove blocks directly above him by repeatedly jumping up into them until they shatter.&#xA;&#xA;Bonus Items litter each room, as well as being hidden in granite blocks, and collecting these will earn the player for extra points. Power-ups can also be found and picked up. These appear as potion bottles with a flame emblazoned on them. When used, Dana shoots a fireball which will start moving along the walls and platforms and will destroy the first demon it comes into contact with.&#xA;&#xA;As well as the bonus items and power-ups, each level also has a hand bell which, when collected, will trigger the release of a trapped fairy. The fairy will slowly fly around the room and can be rescued for bonus points. An extra life is awarded for every ten fairies rescued.&#xA;&#xA;The game&#39;s levels are set around the Zodiac star constellations. The main levels are divided into groups of four - making a total of fourty-eight standard rooms - with each group representing a separate constellation. In addition to the standard rooms, each constellation also has a secret bonus room that can only be accessed by finding the given constellation&#39;s &#39;Seal&#39;, which is located in the last room of each group. There are three further secret rooms - &#39;Page of Time&#39;, &#39;The Page of Space&#39; and the &#39;Princess Room&#39; - that are only accessible if the player has found the &#39;Hidden Seals of Solomon&#39;.&#xA;&#xA;The four room groups are :&#xA;1-4 Aries 5-8 Taurus 9-12 Gemini&#xA;13-16 Cancer 17-20 Leo 21-24 Scorpio&#xA;25-28 Libra 29-32 Virgo 33-36 Sagittarius&#xA;37-40 Capricorn 41-44 Aquarius 45-48 Pisces&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <desc>The first sequel to the superb vertically scrolling shoot-em-up &#34;Sonic Wings&#34;, players once again take control of a Jet fighter aircraft and take to the skies to destroy enemy jets, boats, helicopters, gun emplacements and huge end-of-level bosses. The graphics are every bit as accomplished as those of the prequel and the game delivers a good level of challenge.&#xA;&#xA;The end-of-level bosses change from game-to-game; a nice touch that adds variety to an already solid game.&#xA;&#xA;Players can choose to play as any one of eight different fighter pilots, each of which pilots a different jet :&#xA;* American F-117A Nighthawk piloted by Robo-Keaton. &#xA;* American A-10 Thunderbolt II piloted by Mao Mao. &#xA;* Japanese Fighter-Support X piloted by Hien. &#xA;* Japanese F-15 Eagle piloted by Captain Silver. &#xA;* International F-14 Tomcat piloted by Cindy and Ellen. &#xA;* International YF-23 Black Widow II piloted by Spanky. &#xA;* French Rafale piloted by Steve. &#xA;* British Sea Harrier FRS2 piloted by Bobby.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <desc>The third game in this excellent series adheres to the solid shoot-em-up template set down by its predecessors. The player takes on the role of a Jet Fighter aircraft pilot whose mission is to combat world terrorism. The object of the game is to fly from country to country and destroy all opposition around the world, before flying into outer space to combat the menace responsible for the terrorism. Each pilot has his own storyline that ties in with the game.&#xA;&#xA;One enemy shot destroys the player&#39;s plane and releases a special power-up that the plane may have been carrying. If the player&#39;s final ship is destroyed, all power-ups and extra bombs are released and can be collected if the player chooses the &#39;continue&#39; option, or if a second player is still active. However, on the final mission in Outer Space, the player is forced to start again at the beginning of the space mission, unless 2 players are active.&#xA;&#xA;Sonic Wings now features an array of 10 selectable pilots :&#xA;American Vought F4U Corsair piloted by Robo-Keaton. &#xA;American Northrop P-61 Black Widow piloted by the Blazers. &#xA;Japanese Mitsubishi A6M Zero-Sen piloted by Hien. &#xA;Japanese Aichi M6A1 Seiran piloted by Mao Mao. &#xA;Soviet Il-2 Stormovik piloted by Chaika and Pooshka. &#xA;Soviet Polikarpov I-16 piloted by Spanky. &#xA;German Dornier Do-335 Pfeil piloted by Malcolm (&#39;Pfeil&#39; is german for &#39;Arrow&#39;) &#xA;German Junkers Ju-87 Stuka piloted by Kowful and River. &#xA;British Westland Whirlwind piloted by Alex and Pictus. &#xA;British Fairy Swordfish piloted by Cindy and Ellen. &#xA;&#xA;There are also 2 secret planes (see the TIPS AND TRICKS section for details) :&#xA;The Aka Usagi (Red Rabbit) piloted by Kotomi. &#xA;The Diabloon piloted by The Man.&#xA;&#xA;Planes Spec. :&#xA;Vought F4U Corsair can have 3 power-ups and 5 bombs.&#xA;Northrop P-61 Black Widow can have 3 power-ups and 7 bombs.&#xA;Mitsubishi A6M Zero-Sen have 3 power-ups and 5 bombs.&#xA;Aichi M6A1 Seiran can have 2 power-ups and 5 bombs.&#xA;Il-2 Stormovik can have 2 power-ups and 7 bombs.&#xA;Polikarpov I-16 can have 4 power-ups and 6 bombs.&#xA;Dornier Do-335 Pfeil can have 3 power-ups and 4 bombs.&#xA;Junkers Ju-87 Stuka can have 4 power-ups and 7 bombs.&#xA;Westland Whirlwind can have 3 power-ups and 6 bombs.&#xA;Fairy Swordfish can have 1 power-up and 7 bombs.&#xA;Aka Usagi (Red Rabbit, see below) can have 2 power-ups and 4 bombs.&#xA;Diabloon (see below) can have 7 power-ups and 2 bombs.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <name>Super Puzzle Fighter II X (Japan 960531) </name>
          <desc>Super Puzzle Fighter II X is a puzzle game for one or two players based upon Capcom&#39;s legendary &#34;Street Fighter&#34; and &#34;Vampire&#34; series of fighting games. &#xA;&#xA;Super Puzzle Fighter II X&#39;s gameplay is reminiscent of Sega&#39;s superb 1992 puzzle game, &#34;Puyo Puyo&#34; with players taking on the role of one of the famous Street Fighter characters, represented visually between the two play areas in the middle of the screen. The aim is to manipulate falling coloured gem blocks, matching the colours to gems already in the play area; before finally destroying them with orbs of a like colour. &#xA;&#xA;Gems can only be eliminated by coming into contact with a &#39;Crash Gem&#39; of the same colour. This eliminates all adjacent gems of that colour, setting up the potential for huge chain reactions. &#xA;&#xA;As gems are eliminated, garbage blocks called &#39;Counter Gems&#39; will drop into the opponent&#39;s playfield; these will eventually become normal gems, but only after they count down to zero (most Counter Gem countdowns start at &#39;5&#39; and are reduced by one each time a new pair of gems is dropped on that board), until that time they cannot be eliminated by normal means. The only way to eliminate Counter Gems before they become normal gems is to place a Crash Gem of that colour nearby so it eliminates at least one normal gem. If this is done, all Counter Gems immediately adjacent to the Crash Gem will be taken out as well. &#xA;&#xA;Additionally, gems of the same colour that form squares or rectangles (of at least two blocks tall and wide) in the pit become a giant Power Gem of that size and color; eliminating these as part of a combo increases the number of Counter Gems that would otherwise normally appear on the opponent&#39;s board. &#xA;&#xA;The only other type of piece to appear is a diamond, which eliminates all the normal, Power, Counter and Crash gems of whichever colour gem it lands on. This, too, will cause Counter Gems to appear on the opponent&#39;s board. &#xA;&#xA;Whenever a player destroys a number of blocks, their on-screen Street Fighter counter-part will be shown attacking the opponent character. The fighting move used is dependent on both the colour and number of blocks the player has destroyed. &#xA;&#xA;The available in-game characters, and games from which they are taken (based on first appearance) are : &#xA;* Ryu (&#34;Street Fighter&#34;) &#xA;* Ken (&#34;Street Fighter&#34;) &#xA;* Chun-Li (&#34;Street Fighter II - The World Warrior&#34;) &#xA;* Sakura (&#34;Street Fighter Zero 2 [CP-S II No. 15]&#34;) &#xA;* Morrigan (&#34;Vampire - The Night Warriors [CP-S II No. 05]&#34;) &#xA;* Donovan (&#34;Vampire Hunter - Darkstalkers&#39; Revenge [CP-S II No. 09]&#34;) &#xA;* Lei Lei (&#34;Vampire Hunter - Darkstalkers&#39; Revenge [CP-S II No. 09]&#34;) &#xA;* Felicia (&#34;Vampire - The Night Warriors [CP-S II No. 05]&#34;) &#xA;&#xA;Hidden characters:&#xA;* Gouki (&#34;Super Street Fighter II X - Grand Master Challenge [CP-S II No. 03 Bis]&#34;) &#xA;* Dan (&#34;Street Fighter Zero [CP-S II No. 11]&#34;) &#xA;* Devilotte (&#34;Cyberbots - Fullmetal Madness [CP-S II No. 10]&#34;)&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <name>Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers (Japan 930911) </name>
          <desc>The fourth game in the SFII series featured all new graphics, redone sounds, and above all, four characters new to the series. Here is a full list of changes from previous SFII games:&#xA;&#xA;* New title screen with new music. &#xA;&#xA;* Completely new portraits for all characters. M. Bison (&#39;Vega&#39; in Japan) now has a winged-skull on his hat instead of a star. &#xA;&#xA;* New endings for the bosses. The last part of Chun Li&#39;s ending is also modified, letting the player choose whether she should now live a normal girl&#39;s life or continue being a detective. &#xA;&#xA;* Vega (&#39;Balrog&#39; in Japan) no longer climbs the fence on his stage prior to doing his &#39;Flying Barcelona Attack&#39; or &#39;Izuna Drop&#39; moves. He now just jumps to the edge of the screen and jumps off, as he does in the other stages. &#xA;&#xA;* Voice samples for all characters and announcer re-recorded with different actors. Each character now have their own unique voice so there is no more shared voice samples (e.g. the male &#39;KO&#39; scream). &#xA;&#xA;* Background music playback is handled differently. The background music will play continuously from Round 1 to Round 2 until a character causes the KO sign to flash on Round 2, which will trigger the &#39;Heavy Damage&#39; version of the music. From Round 3 onward, the music is played in the same format as in previous SFII games. &#xA;&#xA;* Four completely new stage backgrounds with new background music to accompany the New Challengers. &#xA;&#xA;* Color schemes for the twelve original stage backgrounds have changed once again : &#xA;1) Ryu stage: The sky is now near evening, and the moon is now white with a touch of light blue. &#xA;2) E.

          <name>Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers (Japan 930910) </name>
          <desc>The fourth game in the SFII series featured all new graphics, redone sounds, and above all, four characters new to the series. Here is a full list of changes from previous SFII games:&#xA;&#xA;* New title screen with new music. &#xA;&#xA;* Completely new portraits for all characters. M. Bison (&#39;Vega&#39; in Japan) now has a winged-skull on his hat instead of a star. &#xA;&#xA;* New endings for the bosses. The last part of Chun Li&#39;s ending is also modified, letting the player choose whether she should now live a normal girl&#39;s life or continue being a detective. &#xA;&#xA;* Vega (&#39;Balrog&#39; in Japan) no longer climbs the fence on his stage prior to doing his &#39;Flying Barcelona Attack&#39; or &#39;Izuna Drop&#39; moves. He now just jumps to the edge of the screen and jumps off, as he does in the other stages. &#xA;&#xA;* Voice samples for all characters and announcer re-recorded with different actors. Each character now have their own unique voice so there is no more shared voice samples (e.g. the male &#39;KO&#39; scream). &#xA;&#xA;* Background music playback is handled differently. The background music will play continuously from Round 1 to Round 2 until a character causes the KO sign to flash on Round 2, which will trigger the &#39;Heavy Damage&#39; version of the music. From Round 3 onward, the music is played in the same format as in previous SFII games. &#xA;&#xA;* Four completely new stage backgrounds with new background music to accompany the New Challengers. &#xA;&#xA;* Color schemes for the twelve original stage backgrounds have changed once again : &#xA;1) Ryu stage: The sky is now near evening, and the moon is now white with a touch of light blue. &#xA;2) E. Honda stage: The walls are now light blue, and the big picture (excluding the sun) is now red-orange. &#xA;3) Blanka stage: The vine where the snake is coiled is now light green, and people to the right have changed a bit. The river behind the village is now a clear blue. &#xA;4) Guile stage: The sky is back to daytime, the canopy on the jet is now clear, and the people in the background are now dressed in blue. The symbol on the ground is back to blue, but the missile linings are still red. &#xA;5) Ken stage: The tugboat has been replaced with a yacht, the two guys on the top now wear orange clothes and white clothes. On the bottom, the first person now wears a green shirt and has gray hair, the second person now wears white t-shirt and yellow pants, the third person now has long hair and wears white top and pink skirt, the fourth person now wears light blue shirt and orange pants, and the guy in the trenchcoat and hat is now replaced by a new person in blue shirt and navy blue pants.&#xA;6) Chun Li stage: The sky is now sunset, the two customers now wear orange, the meat store&#39;s roof is now green with its sign back to red, the guy holding the chicken now wears blue, the &#34;Shanghai Friend Corridor&#34; sign is now red-orange with yellow letters, the guy to the right now wears green pants, and the water sign is now blue.&#xA;7) Zangief stage: The stage floor is now green, and the area to the left is back to red. In addition, the fence on the left foreground is now lowered a bit. &#xA;8) Dhalsim stage: The curtains and stone floor are now green, and the carpet is back to red. &#xA;9) Balrog ([JP] M. Bison) stage: While the stage floor is still purple, the &#39;Las Vegas&#39; on the floor is now yellow. The car to the left is now blue, and the car to the right is now green. The guy throwing the confetti at win/lose now wears yellow, the guy next to the car to the left now wears purple and the guy next to the guy throwing the confetti has been redesigned.&#xA;10) Vega ([JP] Balrog) stage: The stage floor now shows off a green hue, and the fence now comes crashing down at the start of the fight. &#xA;11) Sagat stage: Buddhist statue is still gold, and now it&#39;s sunset.

          <desc>Super Model is a non-nude clone of &#34;New Fantasia&#34; featuring photographic images of both Japanese and western models. The objective is to reveal 80% of the silhouetted girl&#39;s image within the time limit while avoiding the enemies.&#xA;&#xA;To complicate things, there is a bar with a pointer at the top of the screen. If the pointer dips below a certain level (indicated by the change in color) the image will change to that of a monster. The pointer slowly creeps towards the monster side of the bar over time and moves dramatically towards the monster side whenever the player reveals a significant piece of the silhouette. Revealing the un-silhouetted part of the image moves the pointer back towards the girl side of the bar. If a round is completed while the monster&#39;s image is shown then the round must be repeated.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <name>SNK vs. Capcom - SVC Chaos (NGM-2690)(NGH-2690) </name>
          <desc>A one-on-one fighting game - the collaboration between Capcom and SNK - pits seventeen well-known SNK combatants against seventeen of Capcom&#39;s most famous game characters.&#xA;&#xA;&#39;SVC Chaos&#39; primarily utilizes the command system of the &#34;King of Fighters&#34; series, incorporating light/strong kicks, punches, cancels and charging attacks. Unlike its predecessor, however, &#34;Capcom vs. SNK 2&#34;, SvC features no air guards and lacks a &#39;groove system&#39;, instead focusing on quicker game play and online competition.&#xA;&#xA;Each character is equipped with a basic three-bar system for executing &#39;Exceeds&#39; (special attacks), with basic filling options attributed to strikes and damage. Additionally, the sprites from the various series received new models and some special effects were changed in the command lists (For example, the player can no longer increase the damage of the &#39;Zujou Sashi&#39; used by Choi Bounge by tapping the buttons).&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

In addition to the six rally cars of the World Rally mode, the Paris-to-Dakar Rally also allows players to race in either a buggy, a motorbike, or a truck.&#xA;&#xA;All tracks feature a variety of different road surfaces, such as snow, gravel, sand or water.

          <name>Tumble Pop (bootleg set 1) </name>
          <desc>Tumble Pop is a platform game for one or two players in which the aim is to clear each level of enemies by sucking them into - then ejecting them from - a portable vacuum-cleaner. &#xA;&#xA;Holding down the fire button sucks the enemies into the cleaner, releasing the button causes them to be expelled back out. Ejected enemies act as projectiles that can damage and kill any other on-screen enemies that they collide with. All enemies must be killed before players can progress to the next stage. &#xA;&#xA;Throughout the game, letters of the alphabet randomly appear in bubbles. These can be collected to eventually spell the word &#34;TUMBLEPOP&#34;. Once this has been achieved players are transported to a time-limited bonus level, giving them the opportunity to earn bonus points and extra lives. &#xA;&#xA;If players take too long to finish a stage, a Dracula-like enemy appears. If it touches a player before all enemies have been eliminated, a life is lost. This also applies to the Boss levels. &#xA;&#xA;The game feature ten stages, with the first eight set in different parts of the World and the final two set in Outer Space. Each stage has its own themed enemies and level bosses and players can choose to start the game on any of the eight World-based stages. The levels and enemies are: &#xA;*Moscow: Set at the Moscow-state circus, enemies are clowns, invisible conjurers and fire spitters. The boss is a giant clown hanging from helium balloons who juggles bombs. &#xA;*Egypt: Set near the pyramids and Sphinx at Giza, enemies include fire spitters and mummies. The boss is a giant genie who spits fireballs. &#xA;*Paris: Set near the Arc de Triomphe, all of the enemies are robots. The boss is a large flying robot that sends out flying hands. &#xA;*New York City: Set near the Statue of Liberty and World Trade Center, the enemies are pumpkin-headed zombies and octopuses. The boss is a giant octopus. &#xA;*Rio de Janeiro: Set near the statue of Christ the Redeemer, enemies are fire monsters. The boss is a fire dragon. &#xA;*Antarctica: Populated by snowmen, snowmen armed with shovels and hairy yeti-like monsters. The boss is a giant snowman wearing a bucket on its head. &#xA;*Australia. Enemies are carnivorous plants, cavemen and mud men. The boss is a giant two-headed carnivorous plant. &#xA;*Japan: Set at Mount Fuji, enemies are yureis, kappas and skeletons. The boss is a giant pile of daruma dolls. &#xA;*Outer Space: Enemies are grey aliens and spacemen with blaster guns. The boss is a flying robot. &#xA;*The Moon: All bosses from the previous worlds must be fought again. The game&#39;s final boss is a cyborg mad scientist controlling a giant robot.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <desc>Ultimate Ecology is a side-scrolling shoot-em-up with an ecological theme, in which the player must battle a ruthless mega corporation that is slowly destroying the Earth&#39;s eco systems with its industrial machines. &#xA;&#xA;As well as superbly rendered graphics, Eco Fighters features an interesting play mechanic with the addition of an extended metal arm mounted on the side of the player&#39;s ship. On the end of the arm is a weapon that can be rotated through 360 degrees. This weapon comes in four different forms; Energy Ball, Long-range Hammer, Laser Sword or Scatter-Bomb foil. The rotatable weapon can be powered up before being fired, in a similar fashion to the &#39;Force&#39; weapon that featured in Irem&#39;s &#34;R*Type&#34;. The rotatable weapon is also impervious to all enemy contact and can be used as a shield. &#xA;&#xA;In addition to the rotating weapon, the player&#39;s ship is also equipped with forward-firing laser guns. Both the guns and rotatable weapon can be powered-up with greater shot power when the relevant icon is picked up.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <name>Puzzle Uo Poko (International) </name>
          <desc>Uo Poko is a puzzle game for one or two players (co-operative). The aim is to clear the screen of coloured glass balls by dropping like-coloured balls down onto them. Connecting three or more like-coloured balls creates a chain reaction and causes them to disappear.&#xA;&#xA;Balls are launched into the play area via a joystick controlled &#39;pinball-plunger&#39; and as in Pinball, the further the plunger is pulled back, the further the coloured ball will travel. Mastering the strength and distance required is essential in order to drop each ball accurately onto its target. To allow players to learn how to use the plunger, the first two stages feature a guide line which shows exactly where a ball will drop. From the third stage onwards, players must use their judgement alone.&#xA;&#xA;Bonus points are awarded if a stage is completed quickly enough. If too much time is taken, however, the bottom of the stage will start to rise, pushing the balls already in play towards the top of the screen. If the top of the screen is reached, the game is over.&#xA;&#xA;Uo Poko features thirty stages of play.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <desc>Wild Fang is a sideways scrolling beat-em-up for 1 or 2 players with a medieval setting. Players take on a variety of orcs, ogres, demons and other mythical creatures in their bid to destroy Satan, decapitating each enemy they encounter in order to collect their skulls for points and power-ups.&#xA;&#xA;The player&#39;s character is an armor wearing beastmaster who sits atop of a fist-fighting giant.  Upon the player&#39;s command, the player may switch his mount into a tiger and attack with his mace.  Within each stage, there are also power-ups that allow the player to morph into a laser breathing dragon for a limited period of time.&#xA;&#xA;The player&#39;s life bar is represented by a fire breathing dragon in the upper corner.  With each hit the player takes, the fire breath grows smaller.  Once the life bar is depleted the player&#39;s mount is killed and the player travels on foot and fights with throwing daggers.  If hit in this form then the player loses a life.  The game is over when all of a players lives are lost.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>

          <desc>Willow is a sideways scrolling platform shoot-em-up game loosely based upon the movie of the same name. Players take on the role of one of two characters: Willow Ufgood or Madmartigan. The hero&#39;s mission is to rescue the baby Elora Danan from the evil Queen Bavmorda and bring her back safely. If the quest fails, the Queen will plunge the world into darkness and chaos.&#xA;&#xA;The game consists of 6 levels, each representing a scene from the movie. Defeated enemies drop gold coins that can be collected by the player. In addition, each level is littered with locked treasure chests that can be shot open and the treasure within collected. The gold can be used to purchase a number of weapons and character power-ups from a nearby shop (represented on screen by a wise old man). All power-ups will stay with the player until all lives are lost and the game is over.&#xA;&#xA;</desc>
