    <name>2020 Toshi Super Baseball (Japan)</name>
    <desc>Different from real baseball and other baseball video games, this game consists of both male and female characters, as well as robots. All three types of players have the same basic abilities and vary only on their personal strengths. In many cases, human players are better than their robot counterparts. One major difference between the human and robot characters is that the robot characters can blow up (or lose all their power) if they are worked too hard during a game. That can happen if you constantly make them dive for a ball, run extra bases, or even if they get hit by a pitch. Under no stress whatsoever, some robots, especially pitchers, will naturally run out of power as the game progresses. When this happens, they will lose all their abilities and be useless, both offensively and defensively. When that occurs, you can either power them up or replace them with another person on the roster. Human players do not blow up, but human pitchers can tire out. When they are tired, they will pant heavily and throw the ball very slowly. This can be remedied by either an upgrade or, as in real baseball, switching to a relief pitcher.</desc>

Gameplay uses a simple 3-button layout, where the A button lobs the ball, B performs a controlled passing shot and C allows the fastest top spin shots, with the directional pad affecting the direction and depth of the shot.</desc>

Training lets the players team practice without an opposing team on the field. Exhibition is the basic one team versus another for one game. The tournament mode is divided into two different modes; 8 Nations and World Cup. 8 Nations is just a shorter version of the World Cup tournament mode because it involves only 8 teams instead of all 32 of them like it does in the World Cup mode.</desc>

It also started the Advanced Daisenryaku line, all of which have been published by Sega.

Sega and now-renamed SystemSoft Alpha rereleased the game in 2006 as part of Sega Ages 2500.

    <name>Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin, The (Europe)</name>
    <desc>The Mega Drive/Genesis version, developed by Clockwork Tortoise and published by Sega, is a run 'n' gun where both Batman and Robin must stop Mr. Freeze, who plans to freeze Gotham City. In order to keep the duo busy, he also frees the Joker, Two-Face and the Mad Hatter, each one with their own agenda. The Joker celebrates his birthday wreaking havoc in Gotham and stealing diamonds, Two-Face tries to take over the city from above, and Mad Hatter is creating a robot army in his surreal lair.
The game can be played by two players simultaneously; one player with Batman, and the other with Robin. Both characters are identical in terms of playability, and both use batarangs, bolas, or shirukens in long-range attacks, while using melee attacks at short range. There are four levels consisting of several stages, mostly of a straight left-to-right traverse to the end where the boss awaits. In some levels the game switches to a side-scrolling shooter, in which the players must control the Batwings.
The game is regarded as being extremely difficult to complete, and also known for showcasing some of the most impressive special effects on the Mega Drive/Genesis. It also features a soundtrack by Jesper Kyd. This accounts for the relatively high quality of Kyd's compositions, as well as the fairly simple FM synthesized nature of the game's sound effects.</desc>

    <desc>The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle is the video game adaptation of the 60's cartoon series staring Bullwinkle, a moose, and Rocky, a flying squirrel. The game plays out much like an episode of the show. The story begins at the dedication of the Frostbite Falls Rocky and Bullwinkle museum. Unfortunately, the not-so-nice Boris and Natasha have disguised themselves as security guards for the museum and managed to steal some of the priceless artifacts.</desc>

At your disposal is a vulcan cannon (basically a machine gun) and a limited number of missiles. In some versions of the game the guns fire automatically all the time. Sometimes you come across a friendly supply plane and if you dock with it you can replenish your missiles.

The game is viewed from behind the plane with you fighting wave after wave of enemy fighters. But at heart it offers the usual shooter mechanics, meaning you spend most of your time dodging and shooting. You also can speed up and slow down to deal with enemies which appear behind you.</desc>

    <desc>Alien is a video game based on the movie of the same name. The plot of the movie picks up directly after the end of Aliens. Ellen Ripley, the main character of the Alien series, is in cryo-sleep aboard the space ship Sulaco. Unfortunately, an alien or two has stowed away on the Sulaco, and wreaked havoc within the ship. Thus, it crash lands on the prison colony planet Fiorina 161. Ripley and the unarmed prisoners have to figure out a way to survive the aliens terrorizing the colony until help arrives.

The gameplay of the various Alien conversions varies from platform to platform. This version is a side-scrolling action game with large maze-like levels. In each level, you have to rescue all the trapped prisoners and then make your way to the exit, all while surviving multiple alien attacks.

Gameplay features all the usual moves: smashes, passing shots, volleys and all kinds of backhand and forehand plays, but unlike other games, precise positioning and timing are crucial to avoid hitting the ball outside the court, swinging the racket into thin air or more embarrassing, let the ball hit you on the head.
Three courts are available: Grass, Clay and Indoor (Sega versions  add a fourth, Hard), but the differences between them are minimal. Game modes change according to the version, with the 16-bit versions including a "Skins" game, where each point is worth a sum of money based on the number of times the ball was hit.</desc>

    <name>Another World (Europe)</name>
    <desc>Another World is a platform game, where the player uses the keyboard or gamepad to make the protagonist Lester run, jump, attack or perform other actions. In the initial part of the game, Lester is weaponless, able to kick at small creatures but otherwise vulnerable. After escaping with his alien ally, Lester acquires a laser pistol from a fallen foe. The pistol has three capabilities: a standard fire mode, the abilities to create force fields to block enemy fire, and a powerful charged shot that can break through force fields and some walls. Later, Lester also gains a plasma ball that can be used like a grenade to defeat foes. Enemies will also have the same capabilities, requiring the player to take advantage of the three gun modes and the environment to overcome hostile forces and escape.
 
Lester and his alien ally cannot sustain any damage, and the game will be over if either takes a hit. However, the game uses numerous checkpoints, and the player can restart at the last point indefinitely. On older consoles without the ability to save a game, the player can write down an alphanumeric code for these checkpoints and re-enter it when restarting the game later.</desc>

    <desc>Arrow Flash is a side-scrolling space shooter. The player controls a female spaceship pilot who is sent on a mission into deep space to save the Earth from an assault by an evil dragon from another galaxy. Moving vertically or horizontally, players must avoid or kill the enemies and make it to the end of the level alive where a boss battle awaits. During gameplay, the player can switch at any time between two modes: normal spaceship and flying robot. The two forms use different weapons and also have different special abilities, called Arrow Flash. While the spaceship can fire destructive lasers for major damage, the robot can raise a shield that will protect from enemy attacks for some time and instantly kill anything that touches it. The Arrow Flash attacks can be charged by holding a button for several seconds, or collect icons during your flight to release it quickly afterwards.</desc>

    <desc>Yuri Sakazaki has been kidnapped! Her big brother Ryo Sakazaki and Robert Garcia, his best friend, go search for her on the streets of South Town. As they go deeper and deeper they will find clues as to who ordered the kidnapping, the Sakazaki family's relation to the mob, and a person from their past.

This fighting game is a coin-op conversion of the Neo-Geo hit of the same name, and has all characters, stages, and moves featured in the arcade unit. Unlike the original arcade version, players can now play as Mr. Big and the elusive Mr. Karate.

The gameplay differs from most fighting games. In this game, you have a Spirit meter. A Spirit meter is in the game and will decrease as you perform special moves. It can be recharged, but doing so leaves you open to attack. When your health is almost gone, you can perform a secret combination that will unleash a deadly attack on your opponent - provided you have a full Spirit meter.</desc>

    <name>Back to the Future Part III (Europe)</name>
    <desc>Back to the Future III is a collection of four arcade games. Marty McFly and Doc Brown have traveled back through time to the year 1885 - and they're soon deep in trouble when they face "Mad Dog" Tannen's gang and have to find a way to return to the present. This game takes four scenes from the Hollywood movie Back to the Future III and turns them into arcade sequences:
Buckboard Chase: Doc Brown goes horseback in an attempt to save Hill Valley's lovely school teacher Clara. This game of quick ducking, jumping and shooting alternates between a side-scrolling and a top-down perspective.
Shooting Gallery: The name says it all. A classic game of aim-and-shoot, spiced up by hidden extras and bonus targets.
Pie Throwing: Meet the Mad Dog gang. They have guns, and you have... cream pies. It's an isometric version of the shooting gallery, only with ammo. And the targets shoot back.
The Train: Basically a side-scrolling beat-em-up on train wagons with some ducking and jumping. Get rid of the mechanics and collect speed logs to push the engine to a magic 88 mph.</desc>

The upper one can move and turn, allowing you to hit the ball from different angles and from different parts of the screen. You advance through levels by destroying bricks and enemies, going up until the level boss enemy appears.</desc>

    <desc>A year has passed since the events of Streets of Rage. To celebrate the defeat of the mysterious "Mr. X" and his syndicate the previous year, Adam Hunter, Axel Stone, and Blaze Fielding met at their favorite nightspot in the city and spent their time reminiscing about their vigilante crusade against "Mr. X" and his organization. Axel and Blaze had moved out of the city after the adventure from last year. Axel has begun working as a part-time bodyguard and Blaze teaches dance classes. Adam has since rejoined the police force and lives in a small house with his younger brother.
The next morning, Axel received a phone call from Eddie 'Skate' Hunter, Adam's younger brother. Skate had arrived at home from school and was shocked to find his house in ruin and his older brother missing. Attached to the front door was a picture of Adam chained to a wall at the feet of Mr. X. The criminals began to retake the streets once more. Beatings and lootings took place regularly and in broad daylight. Chaos reigned in the city, far worse than before.
Realizing that "Mr. X" and his syndicate has returned for revenge against him, Blaze, and Adam, Axel wastes no time in telling Blaze about the unexpected situation and Blaze herself is determined to help Axel out in defeating "Mr. X" and rescuing Adam. Accompanied by Adam's young brother Skate and Axel's friend, a professional wrestler named Max Thunder, Axel and Blaze set forth on a rescue mission, which will take them from the city all the way to "Mr. X"'s hideout on a desolate island.</desc>

    <desc>In part three of the Streets of Rage series, Mr. X is back and this time his plan involves replacing public officials with his own robots. Only Axel, Blaze, Skate, and new-comer Dr. Zan can stop him. Streets of Rage 3 features all of the beat 'em up action you would expect from a Streets of Rage game. One new feature is the special move power bar, where it only costs energy to do a special move if the bar isn't full. Also new is the ability to do special maneuvers with different weapons, depending on the character. For example, Skate has no special move with the pipe, but does have one with the knife. The opposite is true for Axel. Any weapon Dr. Zan picks up is turned into energy balls which he can throw at the enemies. Secret characters and multiple endings add replay value.</desc>

Batman carries a gauntlet shooting basic bullets by default. This can be upgraded with weapon powerups located in boxes throughout the level, giving access to homing and energy weapons. Every upgrade weapon can be charged up for a secondary attack, different for each weapon. Batman also has a slide useful against most enemies and some bosses.

Boss fights introduce a system where life is measured by points instead of tick marks or bars. In these sections, Batman has significantly more health, and can take many more hits when rumbling with these stronger foes.</desc>

    <name>Batman - The Video Game (USA)</name>
    <desc>Batman - The Video Game is a side-scrolling beat-'em-up which is based on the Tim Burton movie released one year prior. The game bears resemblance to earlier beat-'em-ups like Double Dragon in terms of graphics and to a certain extent gameplay. However, unlike many other beat-'em-ups of its time, Batman lacks two player co-operative play which in a way highlights the shallow gameplay and forgettable story. All of this does not equate to Batman being a 'bad' game, it simply a mediocre title.</desc>

    <desc>Battle Mania Dai Gin Jou (), sometimes referred to as Battle Mania Daiginjou and Battle Mania 2, is a shoot-'em-up developed and published by VIC Tokai in 1993 for the Sega Mega Drive exclusively in Japan and South Korea. It is the sequel to Battle Mania (which was released in the US as Trouble Shooter). The ROM header's International Title field calls the game Trouble Shooter Vintage; this may have been in the intended name had the game been released overseas, and is another name the game is commonly referred to as. Translation group M.I.J.E.T. translated the game's dialogue text to English and included it with their Tougi Ou King Colossus patch as an extra before releasing it separately later.

A group calling itself the Kikokukyou have resurrected the leader of Blackball, the antagonist group of the original game, and the Trouble Shooters are called to stop Blackball and destroy Kikokukyou.</desc>

    <desc>One day, four years after Jason, Eve, and Alex's battles with the Plutonium Boss, a bolt of lightning struck Jason's house in the land he had migrated to four years earlier and caused the ceiling to crumble, knocking him unconscious. When Jason woke up, SOPHIA 3rd NORA MA-02, which he had hidden in an abandoned barn, was in pieces and the parts he had collected four years ago from the Plutonium Boss' mutant Underbosses were missing. Little did Jason know that there were more Lightning Beings, the kinfolk of the Plutonium Boss, and they were planning to destroy the Earth. These beings started digging towards the Earth's core in order to shift the planet's weight off its axis, leading to total annihilation while they sapped the underworld of plutonium. The parts from SOPHIA 3rd were being used to create a template for the robotic army to assist the Lightning Beings in accomplishing their mission. Jason knew he had to stop them, but he also knew he wouldn't make it without the help of SOPHIA 3rd. Since he couldn't recover the parts, he decided to redesign &amp; reconstruct it with (assumedly) the help of Eve to better prepare himself for the ordeal facing him. After 29 days, SOPHIA was completely rebuilt and ready for battle again, now known as SOPHIA 4th.

Following the Beings' footsteps, the group jumped in their new vehicle and headed towards the (presumably) Adirondack Mountains, where their quest began anew. In the end, Jason and company triumphed over the Lightning Beings' underworld invasion, vanquishing the Lightning being known only as the "Mutant Boss." SOPHIA 3rd's parts remained missing.</desc>

    <desc>Bloodshot, known as Battle Frenzy in Germany, is a Sega Mega Drive and Sega Mega-CD game developed by Domark. It is notable for being a 3D first person shooter - one of the few available for the Sega Mega Drive and the only game of this genre for the Sega Mega-CD.

Bloodshot was only released in Mega Drive cartridge form throughout Europe and Australia. It was exclusive to the Sega Channel in North America where it was called by its German name, Battle Frenzy. It is assumed the game was retitled to make the game sound less violent, though the game does not contain any blood ("Bloodshot" is a code name for the fictional "Battle Frenzy" chip implanted in the player").

The Sega Mega-CD version was also exclusive to Europe until 2003, when a North American version under the Battle Frenzy name was released. This version was developed and published by Good Deal Games without the consent of Domark or Acclaim.</desc>

While it was only released in Japan, Kodansha was planning on translating the game as Star Odyssey, but the translation was cancelled for unknown reasons. Two prototypes were independently discovered by drx and by Brandon Cobb, head of Super Fighter Team, who subsequently acquired a license to complete the translation from HOT-B successor company Starfish (who like to revisit old properties), with intentions on releasing it on the twentieth anniversary of the original release. Despite his PR claiming that he received an "unofficial license" from Sega to distribute the game, Sega really asked him to remove their copyrights and trademarks, consequently making the translation fully unlicensed (while Blue Almanac is fully licensed).</desc>

    <desc>The set of punches in the game is pretty much standard, jab, hook, uppercut, even the ever popular but illegal low blow. Also, for each round and every knockdown you score on an opponent, you get a super punch, a straight shot to the face and is almost unstoppable and connected right could knock out your opponent, but if you miss, you lose your punch for the round.

Released in Mexico as Chavez II.</desc>

    <name>Bubble and Squeak (Europe)</name>
    <desc>Bubble and Squeak starts off similarly to many other platform games. Controlling a bald child, you move through a scrolling array of ledges, avoiding contact with nasties who release coins when shot. There are hidden areas to find as well.

Halfway through the first of the 30 levels, you meet Squeak and the full nature of the game starts. Squeak is a blue alien, who must also be guided through the levels. As he can't jump as high as you, he must sometimes be instructed to wait while you flick a switch or otherwise solve the puzzle of how to guide him through. If you stand on top of Squeak you can be launched into an extra-high jump.

Bubble Mode is an equivalent of Super Mario mode - it allows you to jump higher, run faster and shoot more lethal weaponry (bubbles in this case). It is activated by placing a coin into a Bubblegum machine, and then jumping on Squeak's back.

In between the main platform levels there are side-view shoot 'em up sections taking place underwater  completing these earns bonuses.</desc>

    <desc>This version of Buck Rogers: Countdown to Doomsday retains most of the story and the core gameplay of the computer version of the same name, but differs in several gameplay- and interface-related aspects.

The main differences involve reduction of some of the skills and equipment types present in the computer version. Limitations have been imposed on character creation as well: there are only four character classes (Warrior, Rocketjock, Medic, and Rogue) and three races (Human, Desert Runner, and Tinker) to choose from, as opposed to five character classes and six races in the computer release.

In the computer version, first-person view and pseudo-3D graphics were used for navigation, while combat was viewed from isometric perspective. In this release, isometric view is used both for navigation and combat, the player-controlled party visible from third-person perspective.</desc>

Of course, Death appeared and challenged Chakan with a proposition. If Chakan could defeat him, he'd be granted eternal life. However, if Chakan was defeated, he'd become Death's eternal servant. In another side-story, Chakan was so feared by the elders of multiple tribes, they dropped their petty differences and amassed to figure out a way to defeat or contain him, and upon overhearing his boasting, summoned the Grim Reaper themselves, informed the Reaper of his boastings, and contracted him to defeat Chakan.

The battle raged on for several days, spells and swords clashed, until the ultimate victor was very clear...Chakan. Because he defeated Death eventually, he was granted his "reward":

"You are a tactful swordsman, so I will not renege on our wager. I grant you the kiss of eternal life, but, for your arrogance and pride I will temper my gift with this curse. You will be a mere shell of yourself as I strip you of most of your powers. Each nightfall, evils will be shown to you, and the pain of their victims will be your pain. You will never know rest as you wander this world searching to slay the horrors that haunt your sleeping world. You will suffer grievous wounds, but you will not die, and as eternity rolls on, you will crave my touch. Your face will bear my visage, and your eyes will burn with hellfire. But...let it not be said that I am without mercy. There shall be an end to your curse. If all the beasts of the dark are slain, then you may find rest."

Chakan will live forever until he destroys the four supernatural evils of the terrestrial plane (Spider-Queen, Mantis, Elkenrod, and Dragonfly King) and the elemental plane (Parasite, Tundra Beast, the Last Dragon and the Leader of the Dragonfly Clan).</desc>

    <desc>Sixteen levels (in four groups of four) await you in this long-developed Bitmap Brothers title. The basic gameplay is similar to Gauntlet, but in an open air setting, with bridges across rivers and such in the maps. The visuals are in the 'metallic and blue' style the Bitmaps appeared to favor.

There were 6 characters available in the game, each with different strengths and weaknesses, and different starting prices. In 2-player mode you each chose a character and played co-operatively, but in one-player games you also choose a character for the computer to control, with its Artificial Intelligence allowing it to open doors, pick up power-ups and take on baddies away from the ones occupying your character.</desc>

Unlike most, if not all, Mega Drive baseball games, however, you can also take control of the rest of the team when the ball has been hit: you control the player with the ball; the D-pad moves around and C throws the ball.</desc>

    <name>College Slam (USA)</name>
    <desc>Each team starts out by picking any 2 out of 5 players to play with during the game. During timeouts, and at half-time, the player has a choice to make substitutions. When a player makes 2 baskets in a row, the announcer says "He's heating up", and if he makes 3 baskets in a row without the other team scoring, he says "He's on fire!", which makes it easier to score.
In the season mode, the player can pick from 44 teams, and then play a 20 game season against quality competition. In the tournament mode, 16 teams compete for a chance to win the national championship. The player also has the ability to edit teams and players. The game itself is not realistic, as players can easily make full-courts shots and occasionally, players get struck by lightning as they dunk. The final score of the games are usually in the middle to high 100s.</desc>

    <name>Columns (World) (v1.1)</name>
    <desc>The game takes place inside a tall, rectangular playing area, as in Tetris. Columns of three different symbols (such as differently-colored jewels) appear, one at a time, at the top of the well and fall to the bottom, landing either on the floor or on top of previously-fallen "Columns".

While a column is falling, the player can move it left and right, and can also cycle the positions of the symbols within it.

If, after a column has fallen, there are three or more of the same symbols connected in a straight line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, those symbols disappear. The pile of columns then settles under gravity. If this causes three or more other symbols to become aligned, they also disappear and the pile settles again. This process repeats as many times as necessary. It is not uncommon for this to happen three or four times in a row - it often happens by accident when the well is becoming crowded. If the well fills beyond the top of the screen, the game ends.

Occasionally, a special column called the Magic Jewel appears. The Magic Jewel flashes with different colors and when it lands, it destroys all the jewels with the same color as the one underneath it.

Like Tetris, the columns fall at a faster rate as the player progresses. The goal of the game is to play for as long as possible before the well fills up with symbols.

Some ports of the game offer alternate game modes as well. "Flash columns" involves mining their way through a set number of lines to get to a flashing jewel at the bottom. "Doubles" allows two players work together in the same well. "Time trial" involves racking up as many points as possible within the time limit.</desc>

The first criminals in the wanted list can be stopped with your service weapon an some fast reactions, but once you're facing the toughest criminals in town you'll need to use the cyber suit, which provides additional protection and higher firepower.

Unlike other versions of this game, this Genesis cartridge doesn't follow the layout of the arcade game. The levels, rather than being linear, feature some platform elements, and the enemies in the first levels are no longer bank robbers or hit-men, but soldiers and robots instead. And the setting is no longer your typical American city, but a futuristic megalopolis.</desc>

    <desc>Twin Hawk is a typical vertical scrolling shooter with a top-down view. Your goal is easy, shoot all the enemies along the way. You only get a standard gun on your plane, and no bombs. Instead of bombs you can call helper planes. These planes make a formation around you and help to shoot all enemies.

Along the way you get the chance to collect power-ups by shooting transport trucks. When these are destroyed they release a power-up. There are three types. First is the weapon upgrade, with this you get a wider and more powerful shot. Second, you get more calls for helper planes. And third are extra lives.</desc>

The Moon Diver is a ship consisting of three sub-ships, sometimes called wings: Alpha, Beta, and Gamma. You must stop an alien invasion whose base is Danger Seed by going through several "tubes;" however before the game starts Beta and Gamma break off and you must begin with Alpha alone.

A shoots a normal shot which can be rapidfired. B shoots a bomb (you have a limited supply of bombs). As you pass through each tube, your ship collects wings; use C to change the arrangement of wings. Powerups are collected as in most schmups.</desc>

    <desc>The Black Knight has brought misery to the land, and the end way to end this is to enter his haunted house to slay him. You are the brave adventurer taking on this quest through 14 increasingly-tough zones.

The bulk of the game is side-viewed, involving single screens to pass through, which incorporate ropes, cages and trapdoor. There are enemies walking, flying and hovering through this, and many of them respawn. Unusually your weapon to take them on (rocks) can be thrown through 360 degrees, which aims to make the gameplay more realistic and methodical. The screens were linked by hub screens, which the player passes through simply by clicking on a door.</desc>

    <desc>Super Real Darwin is a 1987 arcade shoot-'em-up by Data East. Sega ported it to the Sega Mega Drive and released it in 1990 exclusively in Japan under the name Darwin 4081 ().

The game controls like a regular shoot-'em-up: A and C shoot bullets, B drops bombs; there is rapidfire. However, unlike regular shoot-'em-ups where weapons are upgraded through powerups, your ship "evolves" to survive situations and get past obstacles. Evolution occurs with the Evol (small faces with an E on them) and B-Evol (darker Evols). Each pickup adds a new evolution state to the list. After a particular amount of time, one evolution wears off and the next evolution is chosen. The DNA powerup does provide a more permanent weapon upgrade, but will merely just make the existing weapons stronger. You can hold up to nine DNA powerups.</desc>

    <desc>Imagine an adventure game in the format of pinball, and you get Dragon's Fury. Your hero is a small silver ball, and your battlefield is a three-tiered pinball machine. Using your ball, you can defeat monsters, rack up points, and enter bonus stages. If you play with enough skill, you can trigger all sorts of point-accumulating bonuses. If you get one billion points, you get to fight the final boss and view the ending to the game.</desc>

    <desc>"Devilish" is different from other paddle games by letting you play with two paddles. The lower one behaves just like a usual paddle - you use it to prevent the ball from dropping down. The upper one can move and turn, allowing you to hit the ball from different angles and from different parts of the screen. You advance through levels by destroying bricks and enemies, going up until the level boss enemy appears.</desc>

    <desc>This is one of the games based on the Dick Tracy movie. You are Dick Tracy, a police detective who enjoys a peaceful life with his wife. But his wife's father is murdered by a local gangster named Big Boy Caprice, and Dick Tracy is now out for revenge. The game doesn't follow the exact plot of the movie, but simply lets Dick Tracy fight his way through several levels until he faces his archenemy.

This is a platform shooter/"beat-'em-up" game. Plenty of gunmen will attack our hero from all the sides. Dick can only move to the right or to the left. He can use his pistol gun to take out enemies who are in front or behind him. Since he can't approach enemies who attack from the depth of the screen, he can dispose of them using his machine gun. When the enemy is too close, Dick will punch him instead of shooting.</desc>

Another aspect of the license is that the variety of offensive and defensive strategies and formations for player and AI use are pulled from the pages of Coach Vitale's own playbook.

The game features a 3/4 pseudo-3D perspective similar to that available on the SNES console in Mode 7. There are 32 college teams to choose from in four conferences, and games are played by official NCAA rules. Available gameplay modes include Single Game, 2-on-2, Slamfest (a simple slam-dunk contest), and Tournament. The AI can take control of defense, and the game can be played without foul rules.</desc>

    <desc>Dragon Slayer: Eiyuu Densetsu (), called Dragon Slayer: The Legend of Heroes outside Japan, is the sixth main game in Falcom's Dragon Slayer series, following Sorcerian. It was first released on the NEC PC-88 in 1989 and would eventually find its way onto a number of other consoles. In 1994, Sega Falcom produced a port to the Sega Mega Drive released exclusively in Japan.

As with other main series Dragon Slayer games, Eiyuu Densetsu recevied its own sequels in a subseries, the first of which is Dragon Slayer: Eiyuu Densetsu II, also ported to the Mega Drive by Sega Falcom. In the main series, it was followed by Lord Monarch, which also had a Mega Drive adaptation produced by Sega Falcom.</desc>

As with Eiyuu Densetsu, it was ported to a number of systems, including to the Sega Mega Drive in 1995 by Sega Falcom exclusively in Japan.

The Dragon Slayer series would continue with Lord Monarch, which also saw an entry on the Mega Drive. However, with the next The Legend of Heroes game, Eiyuu Densetsu III: Shiroki Majou, Falcom decided to break the series away from Dragon Slayer. This third game was ported to the Sega Saturn in 1998.</desc>

It is a member of Activision's Shanghai series of mahjong solitaire games  to be precise, it is a port of the Japanese version of what the Western market got as Shanghai II: Dragon's Eye; the numbering discrepancy was because of a Japanese Shanghai II that had already been made.

Activision were not happy with this version of the game, and instead produced their own Shanghai II: Dragon's Eye for the Western market.</desc>

As in the original game, the player controls the troops of one of three noble Houses, called by the Emperor to mine the Spice Melange on the planet Arrakis, also known as Dune. A series of consecutive battles must be won by mining spice, constructing a base and building units to attack the enemy.

The rather complex menu-based controls of the original game have been replaced by a context-sensitive cursor system, where a unit reacts according to what is below the cursor - either moving to a destination or attacking an enemy unit, for example.</desc>

The characters find themselves in a strange, red-hued world in which the horizon slopes upward in all directions, eventually vanishing into a crimson haze at the limits of sight. Their mission is to find and make allies in this new world or else the kingdom and its culture will perish.

The player leads a party of four characters (either the default party or one that the player has created). Characters and races can be chosen from the normal D&amp;D options. The gameworld is viewed from an isometric perspective and the characters can roam around in realtime. Battles are turn based. Like most role-playing games, the gaming experience focuses on exploration, inventory management and character development.</desc>

    <desc>The city is besieged by wanted criminals, and as a police officer it is your duty to stop them. The first criminals in the wanted list can be stopped with your service weapon an some fast reactions, but once you're facing the toughest criminals in town you'll need to use the cyber suit, which provides additional protection and higher firepower.

Unlike other versions of this game, this Genesis cartridge doesn't follow the layout of the arcade game. The levels, rather than being linear, feature some platform elements, and the enemies in the first levels are no longer bank robbers or hit-men, but soldiers and robots instead. And the setting is no longer your typical American city, but a futuristic megalopolis.</desc>

    <name>Earnest Evans (USA)</name>
    <desc>The story of the game is connected to that of El Viento. Earnest Evans is a brave treasure hunter. His grandfather was a famous archaeologist who searched for three legendary idols in the 1930s. It was said that those idols could bring disaster upon the Earth if fallen into the wrong hands. But despite his efforts, he could never find even one of the idols. Now it's up to the grandson to continue his work, fifty years later. But the evil syndicate leader Brady Tressider has his own plans, and will do anything to stop Earnest...

This is an action platform game in which you control Earnest Evans, armed with his trusty whip. The hero can jump, climb ropes, crouch, and crawl. There are plenty of obstacles on the levels (bottomless pits, spikes, crushing bridges, lava, etc.), as well as gangsters and monsters to dispose of.</desc>

Its true identity is unknown - whereas the ROM header lists the game's name as "Elf Wor", the title screen calls it  (Spiritual Magic Priest), and Super Magician. It has also been referred to as Reigen Doushi and Revenge of Fu Manchu.

The game is strikingly similar to Zombies Ate My Neighbors, though has a more eastern setting.</desc>

    <desc>Steel Empire (originally released as Koutetsu Teikoku in Japan, and otherwise known in various English materials as The Steel Empire or Empire of Steel), is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up video game released on the Sega Genesis / Mega Drive home consoles in 1992, and was later ported to the Nintendo Game Boy Advance in 2004.

Steel Empire is notable amongst shoot 'em up games for its unique aesthetic designs. Mostly low-tech in nature, with it being set in the late-19th century of an alternate world, the game's aircraft, weaponry, powerups, environments, enemies and bosses are heavily stylized adding strong steampunk elements to the style, themes and visuals of the game. Steam power, propeller-based aircraft, biplanes, dirigibles and heavily-armored steam trains with giant cannons play large roles in the game's protagonists and opponents.</desc>

    <desc>Operation Europe: Path to Victory is a multiplatform war game where one or two players can compete in World War II action. The object of the game is to fulfill any one of the military objectives for either the Axis or the Allied forces. Players engage in modern warfare around Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Central Europe, and North Africa.

This game uses abstract numbers and figures in the map view and saves the concrete illustrations of soldiers only when they lock horns on the battlefield or in an urban setting. Urban settings give a traditional 1930s view of housing and office buildings that provide extra protection for units that are guarding them. However, there are massive numbers to crunch and the lack of graphics help enhance the number crunching ability of game's artificial intelligence.</desc>

    <name>European Club Soccer (Europe)</name>
    <desc>European Club Soccer has dozens of teams from all across Europe (around 170), and each country is represented by at least two teams. In addition to correct club names, it also has recognizable imitations of team badges and kits; although more elaborate kits (such as those worn by Juventus, FC Porto or Celtic F.C.) are simplified (Juventus have a silver shirt, Porto blue and Celtic green). Player names, on the other hand, were made by mixing names found on real squads. Portuguese teams, for instance, had a large number of Yugoslavian players in the early 1990s, and that was reflected by players with names such as Valentim Ivic (of Valentim Loureiro and Tomislav Ivic, then Boavista FC chairman and S.L. Benfica manager, respectively). Names could not be changed, and since the game lacked a battery, it does not store changes done to kits and passwords were used to resume tournaments (example of a password sheet). Rotherham United are included amongst the English clubs despite never playing in the top tier of English football, this is due to the developer, Krisalis Software, being based in Rotherham. All other clubs have played in their own country's top tier.</desc>

    <name>Exodus - Journey to the Promised Land (USA) (Unl)</name>
    <desc>Crystal Mines is a 1989 unlicensed puzzle game for the NES by Color Dreams. When they established Wisdom Tree, they repackaged the game twice: in 1991 as Exodus: Journey to the Promised Land and in 1992 as Joshua &amp; The Battle of Jericho, with Joshua labeled a sequel to Exodus. These two versions would be remade for the Sega Mega Drive in 1993 and 1994, respectively.
Though the games do have a TMSS check, they will only do the $A14000 write if they detect the region of the console they are running on as US  therefore, the games will only boot on either any US Mega Drive or on any other Model 1 Mega Drive without TMSS (making that a partly useless form of region lockout).

Gameplay of both versions is identical: you are the main character (Moses or Joshua, respectively) and you must collect all the bags with M on them (Joshua: coins with $ on them) scattered throughout each maze. A and C shoot; you can hold them down for rapidfire. Shooting destroys blockades and enemies. Once all the M bags are gathered, find the exit to move on to the next level. In between each level, you must answer a bunch of questions related to the story of the Bible of the game's theme; getting them wrong appears to be inconsequential to the outcome of the game (this needs investigation).</desc>

    <name>F1 (Europe)</name>
    <desc>F1 is an Official Formula One Racing Game. There are two modes of play available: "Arcade", "Grand Prix". In both of these modes you complete a certain number of laps (4, 8, or 12) and select which circuit that you want to race on. The circuits include San Marino, France, Britain, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Japan, and Australia. Some circuits are easy, while some are difficult. 

There are slight differences between the two modes. For instance, "Arcade" allows you to select the circuit in any order that you like, whereas "Grand Prix" only allows you to fine-tune your car before starting a race. You also need to race a circuit in the order that they appear on the circuit selection screen, but you can skip a track if you want.</desc>

    <desc>FIFA Soccer 96 was extremely popular at the time of release. It was hailed as the first really successful FIFA release, and opened the way for yearly revisions of the concept.

There were a number of factors that made FIFA96 stand out from the crowd of other football sims. Firstly, the game's commentary was revolutionary at the time -- the renowned British commentator John Motson comments all the incidents and happenings on the pitch in real-time. The ambient commentary is varied, and systems with more than the minimum memory level get extra commentary phrases.</desc>

    <desc>This is a vertical platformer with horizontal wrap-around. For the entertainment of the futuristic masses, you play a criminal that has been inserted into a mechanical body with the promise that if you succeed in surviving through all the levels (there are many and they are hard), you will be set free. You start each level at the bottom, near pooling liquid which will soon rise, at your immediate peril. Navigate the level from bottom to the exit at the top before the liquid rises and kills you. There are many other foes that fly around, causing you damage and basically annoying you to spit. Most levels must be navigated through a series of keyed gates, doors, or portals. These shaped keys are scattered around the map and must by picked up and used only on the gates they match individually. Twist: You can only carry one special weapon (triple shot, laser beam, or vertical shot) and one tool (key, liquid-freeze, or a red herring) at a time. This game requires a lot of memorization of enemy movement patterns and optimum routes. A unique feature is that when you die, you can watch a replay and take over at any point to continue your game. You can also hit the HELP button at the start of each level to view a map, helping you plan your route.</desc>

    <desc>Final Blow is an action game based around the sport of boxing. You can play the fighters in a sequence of knock-out competitions, (the computer versions also include a round-robin league). Rounds last one minute, with a short break in between them. As in the real sport, your aim is to knock your opponent down for 10 seconds, by gradually weakening him with a series of punches. You can block punches, to avoid them inflicting damage onto you. The ring is of a limited size, so players can be cornered, although the referee will intervene to break the boxers up if they become entangled in a stalemate position.</desc>

    <desc>Flux is a music visualizer software developed by EXP for the Sega Mega Drive and released by Virgin Interactive exclusively in Europe. When the Mega Drive is connected to a Sega Mega-CD, an audio CD is in the CD tray, and this cartridge in the Mega Drive, Flux will have the Mega CD play the music on the CD and show various user-configurable effects (the default being a two-channel oscilloscope). B pauses playback, Left and Right skip tracks, and Start brings up the configuration panel.

The cartridge works for two reasons  the Mega CD supports using a cartridge as a boot image (this was also done with Wonder Library) and supports having the boot image access the CD drive for audio playback. Kega Fusion can emulate all this specifically for Flux; instructions are in its readme file. It requires a small modification to its configuration file and a European Mega CD BIOS to work.</desc>

    <desc>Before marketing fat-reducing grills, boxing legend George Foreman endorsed this boxing game with a 3rd-person view similar to Punch Out. A full range of punches and jabs are available, with full round-by-round scoring from the judges. You can choose from 3-12 rounds, and there are 2 camera views as well as an automatic switch option.

You can play simple exhibition matches or tournaments, or launch into a career mode. In this you start at the bottom of the world rankings, and must reach the top by beating the game's players, who other than George are all fictitious boxers with varying strengths and weaknesses. The coach gives advice before each fight to help highlight weaknesses in your play. There are passwords for each round.</desc>

    <desc>F1 is an Official Formula One Racing Game. There are two modes of play available: "Arcade", "Grand Prix". In both of these modes you complete a certain number of laps (4, 8, or 12) and select which circuit that you want to race on. The circuits include San Marino, France, Britain, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Japan, and Australia. Some circuits are easy, while some are difficult. 

There are slight differences between the two modes. For instance, "Arcade" allows you to select the circuit in any order that you like, whereas "Grand Prix" only allows you to fine-tune your car before starting a race. You also need to race a circuit in the order that they appear on the circuit selection screen, but you can skip a track if you want.</desc>

There are 6 distinct game modes, allowing for single exhibition matches as well as full seasons on the playoffs. There is also a Home Run Derby mode, allowing the player to pelt the ball out of the ground for points. 

You can choose pitchers and batters, based on their statistics and form. Bowling options are set to define the delivery, with fastballs and curveballs as well as more precise setting of pace and height. Fielding is optional - it's best to leave this to the computer at first You can always alter the infield and outfield depth and shift.</desc>

The road is full of cars and trucks, at variable speeds. The river water itself is fatal, as are the snakes which hover within on later levels. Frogger must use the arrangement of logs, turtles (which are only there for a short time) and alligators (but stay away form their faces), and then jump into one of the open home-cells, ideally one containing a fly for extra points.

On each stage a set number of "funnys" will cross the screen, and the player must shoot a certain number of them before they can safely reach the other side. To make things harder, some will walk, some will run, and some will move erratically; from time to time a female funny will cross the screen, which if shot will cause the player to lose a life. They player also has a certain number of boulders they can drop, which will hit any funny on the screen that may be out of the player's range. If enough funnys are hit, the player moves on to the next stage.

Balloon Boy is an action game where the player controls a boy at the bottom of the screen who must shoot at balloons floating across the top. When shot, the balloons will release either a trap or an item, and the boy must collect the items while avoiding the traps. If all the balloons are destroyed before the time runs out, the player moves on to the next stage.</desc>

Gameplay consists of flying through six air and water levels: Gadget Bay, Zeppelin Attack, The Lost City, Sub Attack, The Crystal Lake and Thump's World. Although the game continually scrolls throughout its stages, the player can fly in all directions on the screen. Bop and Bump come equipped with a spring glove mechanism that lets the player punch either up, down, right or left, which is used to defeat enemies.

Defeated enemies drop coins. There are also chests littered throughout the stages which contain coins also. These coins can be spent at a shop where the player can purchase upgrades.

The game also contains bonus stages where the objective is to open all the chests in a limited amount of time.</desc>

    <desc>It's the year 300x. The Earth has been ravaged by careless humans, leaving an uninhabitable, polluted wasteland. The space terrorists, Gulfer, plan to harvest the pollution to make some sort of garbage weapon. The good guys, the Leezaluth, aren't happy about that, so they decide they have to blow up the Earth before Gulfer gets at it. They give Earth an ultimatum: destroy Gulfer or Leezaluth destroys Earth. To help them out, Leezaluth gives Earth's last hero, Dan, a special weapon: the TOZ system.

Why don't the Leezaluth just stop Gulfer themselves? It's not exactly clear.

So, we have the premise for a side scrolling shooter. The star attraction here is the TOZ system. The TOZ is an orb that follows your ship around, and can be shot at enemy ships to absorb their weapons. Using the TOZ, Dan will fight through 8 stages filled with lots of enemies and really large bosses.</desc>

    <desc>Sega Game Toshokan (), meaning Sega Game Library, is a Sega Mega Drive cartridge distributed with select Mega Modems starting 1991. With the Mega Modem connected, this cartridge in the cartridge slot, and a Sega Meganet subscription, consumers could download and play select Mega Drive games exclusively available through the service, all of which came out on the service in 1991.

Two such games, Flicky and Shi no Meikyuu: Labyrinth of Death (called Fatal Labyrinth overseas), saw retail release outside Japan prior to the launch. Another, Teddy Boy Blues, was a port of an earlier game that had already been released internationally. A fourth, Columns, was already released in Japan retail. All the others were never released outside Japan and originated on Game Toshokan. All the games were eventually rereleased as part of the Game no Kanzume series, several Sega Ages compilations, and Sega's B-Club! service for downloading Mega Drive games to play on a PC.</desc>

Of more significance, however, is the game's Artificial Intelligence system, in which creatures monitor how you play, and try to find safer positions. Also, the game offers more bonuses and power-ups if you're struggling to progress. Even without those, there are lots of bonus sections to find and unlock.</desc>

    <name>Golden Axe (World) (v1.1)</name>
    <desc>The game takes place in the fictional land of Yuria, a Conan the Barbarian-style high fantasy medieval world. An evil entity known as Death Adder has captured the King and his daughter, and holds them captive in their castle. He also finds the Golden Axe, the magical emblem of Yuria, and threatens to destroy both the axe and the royal family unless the people of Yuria accept him as their ruler. The character of Death Adder and the stolen Golden Axe could well be traced to the historical event of the Acquisition of the True Cross during the Sassanid-Byzantine wars, as the Norse mythology is heavily influenced by Greek and Middle Eastern mythologies.
The player controls one of three Warriors. The first is a battle axe-wielding dwarf, Gilius Thunderhead, from the mines of Wolud, whose twin brother was killed by the soldiers of Death Adder. Another is a male barbarian, Ax Battler, wielding a two handed broadsword looking for revenge for the murder of his mother. The last is a long-sword-wielding Tyris Flare, an amazon, whose parents were both killed by Death Adder.</desc>

Plans were made to port the game to the US under the name Power Instinct, but were scrapped (however a US SNES version was released under this name).

The game is a conventional fighter. A, B, and C each perform a different variation of each character's base attack, with various combinations possible with the D-pad.</desc>

In Grind Stormer the ship always moves at a fast speed and the player can collect bombs that damage the entire screen and fend off bullets. The other variant V Five takes a Gradius-approach to power-ups, having the player advance through a selection of power-ups shown on the right by collecting tokens. In the first mode power-ups are immediately applied. In the second mode the ship is much slower and the player needs to decide to spend tokens on speed power-ups right away or save them to advance to seeking bullets or additional power.</desc>

    <name>Gunstar Heroes (Japan)</name>
    <desc>Gunstar Heroes is a side scrolling shooter. The player has four weapons to choose from, and they can be combined in various pairs to create a total of 14 unique weapons. In addition to the weapons, the player can engage enemies in close quarters combat. It is possible to grab and toss enemies, perform sliding and jumping attacks and a long-range skid.

Unlike most games in the genre, the player has a life total calculated in numbers. Death to a player requires multiple hits but just one death will issue the option to continue from the start of the level or to end the game. Players have unlimited continues.

The main highlight of the game are its boss encounters, which often feature large enemies made up of multiple sprites allowing for fluid movement.</desc>

In the first you must progress (initially purely horizontally, though later with vertical flick-scrolling as well) through a hostile environment of enemies, bombs and traps, gaining points for doing it quickly and with lots of energy left. Initially you can fly and kick as needed.

Once this section is complete, you move on to one-on-one combat of the Street Fighter 2 style. The early foes have far less energy than you begin with. As you progress through the game, you are awarded extra attacking moves, in a manner similar to Brutal: Paws of Fury</desc>

The Japanese version, titled Shin Seikimatsu Kyseishu Densetsu Hokuto no Ken ( ?, "New Legend of the End-of-Century Savior: Fist of the North Star"), is based on the manga series Hokuto no Ken (Fist of the North Star in English). Since the international version did not retain the Hokuto no Ken license, the graphics and characters' names were altered. It was the second Hokuto no Ken game released by Sega, following the Mark III original (released internationally as Black Belt). Versions for the Commodore 64 and Amiga based upon Last Battle were developed and released by Elite in Europe in 1991.</desc>

    <name>Home Alone 2 - Lost in New York (USA)</name>
    <desc>The McCallister family is off to Miami for a Christmas vacation in the sun. The son, Kevin, ends up on the wrong plane and winds up in New York City all by himself. The two-man bandit team he helped catch in the first film also just so happen to be there, and are out for revenge.

Home Alone 2 is an action platform game based loosely on the 1992 film of the same title. Starting in the airport, the player controls Kevin as he runs around New York, visiting locations similar to those in the film, and outwitting the bandits Harry and Marv, who turn up to harass him at almost every turn. Kevin has a variety of kid-friendly weaponry handy to take on his enemies, including baseballs, footballs, and slingshots.</desc>

    <name>Hua Mu Lan - Mulan (China) (Unl)</name>
    <desc>Hua Mu Lan: Mulan is an unlicensed action game by some unknown developer for the Sega Mega Drive made some unknown year. It is based on either the Chinese legend of Hua Mulan or the 1998 Disney film of the same name  which it steals art from, giving us a potential earliest release date. Some of its music is stolen from another unlicensed game, Chuanpu's 1996 Ya Se Chuan Shuo; whether or not the rest is also stolen has yet to be determined.

Interestingly enough, the game has a story screen... in Chinese, English, Spanish, Portugese, and Arabic. The stories appear to be identical: during the Tang Dynasty, the Hun warlord Tan-Yu led his soldiers to seize the dynasty, and Tang conscripts all men to fight the oncoming forces. Hua Mulan, not wanting to see her old father fight, goes in to fight for him.

The game is a typical platformer. B attacks and C jumps.</desc>

Game modes include exhibition, tour and tournament for both singles and doubles.

Along the usual offering of lobs, volleys, passing shots, top spins and slashes, the player can leave player movement to the console, and just focus on hitting the ball with the right shot with the correct timing (the player can also set the playing style, from all-court, baseline, or rush net). For those needing a boost of confidence before entering competitive play, Vic Braden, one of the most well known tennis coaches, has a court with special lines, a ball machine and some hints to help them improve their play.</desc>

    <desc>The Immortal is an isometric action-adventure game.

Your old mentor Mordamir has disappeared. Probably kidnapped. You're not too sure where he might be, but a dungeon is always a good place to look, so you seek out the nearest one and plunge into its depths. Beware: 8 levels of isometric death await.

The Immortal is the prototype of a trial-and-error game. Progress is made by encountering a hazard, dying, solving the problem, encountering the next hazard. To solve a level, you have to know its traps and their patterns by heart. As frustrating as this may sound (it is), The Immortal quite cleverly balances annoyance with curiosity and graphical rewards.</desc>

The objective is to place all of the tiles onto the board and obtain the highest possible score by following specific rules of play. There are ways to play that can dramatically increase the score, which makes the game very strategic in nature. Additionally, when desired, the player can get an oracle reading by asking a question, which is answered when the player makes a very elegant play (four-way match).</desc>

    <desc>Itchy &amp; Scratchy is a single player platform side-scroller. The player controls Itchy, the mouse, and must defeat Scratchy, the cat, with a variety of weapons. Itchy caries a default mallet, but can pick up additional weapons on particular levels. Each of the seven levels takes place in a different fictional location and is designed as a maze of doors and platforms. After defeating Scratchy, he usually will return with a special contraption to attack Itchy, and must therefore be defeated again.</desc>

    <name>Izzy's Quest for the Olympic Rings (USA, Europe)</name>
    <desc>Izzy's Quest for the Olympic Rings is the official game of the mascot of the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta. As the name suggests, Izzy must find the five Olympic rings, hidden by the guardians so that Izzy does not take them to his world.

The game plays a lot like Mario games; to eliminate an opponent Izzy must jump over his head. There are two jumps available, the ball jump suitable for height and the hurdle jump, suitable for distance. Both allow Izzy to clear an enemy, but the second harms him.If Izzy is hit, then he must find three medals, or at the next hit he loses a life. There are some extra objects, like Olympic torches, and eggs that hatch either objects for bonus points, trampolines or morph points to reach otherwise inaccessible areas or traps. Izzy can also morph into a glider, a baseball player, an archer or a rocket, among others, to overcome some sections of the levels.</desc>

    <name>J. League Champion Soccer (Japan)</name>
    <desc>European Club Soccer has dozens of teams from all across Europe (around 170), and each country is represented by at least two teams. In addition to correct club names, it also has recognizable imitations of team badges and kits; although more elaborate kits (such as those worn by Juventus, FC Porto or Celtic F.C.) are simplified (Juventus have a silver shirt, Porto blue and Celtic green). Player names, on the other hand, were made by mixing names found on real squads. Portuguese teams, for instance, had a large number of Yugoslavian players in the early 1990s, and that was reflected by players with names such as Valentim Ivic (of Valentim Loureiro and Tomislav Ivic, then Boavista FC chairman and S.L. Benfica manager, respectively). Names could not be changed, and since the game lacked a battery, it does not store changes done to kits and passwords were used to resume tournaments (example of a password sheet). Rotherham United are included amongst the English clubs despite never playing in the top tier of English football, this is due to the developer, Krisalis Software, being based in Rotherham. All other clubs have played in their own country's top tier.</desc>

    <desc>Final Blow is an action game based around the sport of boxing. You can play the fighters in a sequence of knock-out competitions, (the computer versions also include a round-robin league). Rounds last one minute, with a short break in between them. As in the real sport, your aim is to knock your opponent down for 10 seconds, by gradually weakening him with a series of punches. You can block punches, to avoid them inflicting damage onto you. The ring is of a limited size, so players can be cornered, although the referee will intervene to break the boxers up if they become entangled in a stalemate position.</desc>

    <desc>The gameplay is based on fighting a lot of monsters in classic arcade platform kind of way. To do this you have at your disposal rings, two which you begin with and further more that you gain along the way. Each ring is of one of the four elements and by combining them you gain different effects. Rings of opposite elements cancel each other but you have to hands and two attack buttons so you can use say water on the one and fire on the other. The rings are also different in strength which further adds some complexity.</desc>

    <name>Joe &amp; Mac (USA)</name>
    <desc>The game stars the green-haired Joe and the blue-haired Mac, cavemen who battle though numerous prehistoric levels using, weapons such as boomerangs, bones, fire, flints, electricity, stone wheels, and clubs. The objective of the game is simply rescuing a group of girls who were kidnapped by a rival tribe of cavemen. The gameplay is somewhat similar to Contra and has a Gauntlet-style health system, where the player loses health over a period of time apart from in boss battles. This health system is also not unlike that of Sega's Wonder Boy. The game could be played in either single player or two player mode. In the two player mode, both characters could hurt each other. The game was also notable for its cartoony graphics, humor, and sound effects.

The original arcade version had the distinction of allowing the player to select between different routes (much like Taito's Darius) at the end of a boss battle. Also, after defeating the final boss, the players can choose between three exits, each one leading to a slightly different ending sequence.</desc>

    <name>Joshua &amp; the Battle of Jericho (USA) (Unl)</name>
    <desc>Crystal Mines is a 1989 unlicensed puzzle game for the NES by Color Dreams. When they established Wisdom Tree, they repackaged the game twice: in 1991 as Exodus: Journey to the Promised Land and in 1992 as Joshua &amp; The Battle of Jericho, with Joshua labeled a sequel to Exodus. These two versions would be remade for the Sega Mega Drive in 1993 and 1994, respectively.
Though the games do have a TMSS check, they will only do the $A14000 write if they detect the region of the console they are running on as US  therefore, the games will only boot on either any US Mega Drive or on any other Model 1 Mega Drive without TMSS (making that a partly useless form of region lockout).

Gameplay of both versions is identical: you are the main character (Moses or Joshua, respectively) and you must collect all the bags with M on them (Joshua: coins with $ on them) scattered throughout each maze. A and C shoot; you can hold them down for rapidfire. Shooting destroys blockades and enemies. Once all the M bags are gathered, find the exit to move on to the next level. In between each level, you must answer a bunch of questions related to the story of the Bible of the game's theme; getting them wrong appears to be inconsequential to the outcome of the game (this needs investigation).</desc>

    <desc>Some time after Operation Desert Strike, Ibn Kilbaba, son of Kilbaba S.R, threatens to annihilate America. After his father was killed, the people who were under his control, sent his son running off, along with his father's money and nuclear weapons program. Kilbaba, more ruthless than his father, longs for revenge of his father's death and decides to shed the blood of those who killed him, the Americans. Already armed, Kilbaba hires Carlos Ortega to help him set up his Nuclear Weapons program, deep in South America. Carlos Ortega, the world's most notorious druglord, also yearns to seek revenge. With his own private army, armed with the most hi-tech weapons, he's ready to fight America at all costs. 

Because of this threat, you're hired again to battle these two characters, following their paths in the jungles of South America. Armed with the Commache, numerous other vehicles, and destructive weapons, you must take out their private army. Blow up the enemy with your hellfires, hydras, chain guns. Use the watercraft to launch mines at enemy ships. Pull off a drive-by on the enemy with guns on the side. Take out the evil duo and forever rid this threat.....in the jungle!</desc>

    <desc>The basic Outrun game structure is reused in this, with the main difference being that a futuristic setting has been used. The circuits have some spectacular inclines, and the cars do nearly 700km/h. There are four different track sequences on offer, and your aim is to complete each section of track within the time limit. As in the original OutRun game, near the end of each stage there are forks in the road, allowing you to choose different routes within the track sequences. There are other cars on the road to avoid as well.</desc>

    <desc>This game can be played in two modes, either as Dr. Alan Grant or as a Velociraptor. Playing as each provides the user with an alternative story and level design. The climax of the game mirrored the unused climax of the film, in which Grant must defeat a pair of Velociraptors by causing the Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton in the Visitors Center to collapse on top of them. Grant himself is the final boss in the same location for the raptor storyline: your dinosaur character must cause the bone structure to collapse via specifically placed kicks to cause Grant to flee. A sequel was released using a new game engine and new artwork (with some of the original art as well), entitled Jurassic Park: Rampage Edition. In it, Grant's helicopter (that he just escaped on in the first game) crashes. Now he must deal not only with dinosaurs, but InGen as well. A new raptor must also make it off the island.</desc>

    <desc>Jurassic Park: Rampage Edition is the sequel to the first Jurassic Park game on Genesis and mostly looks and plays like the predecessor. It is also a side-scroller.

In this game you play as Dr. Grant. The big difference with the first game is that there are more enemies to defeat. In addition to the dinosaurs you have to defeat many InGen agents. The reason is that they are trying to recapture dinosaur DNA and eggs to build a new park or an army of dinosaurs.</desc>

The game allows you to move your character in any direction, provided he doesn't leave the confines of the arena, and allows you to attack via mostly a combination of button presses that also trigger dodges and parries depending on the button pressed.

    <desc>Kick Off 3: European Challenge is a football game developed by Steve Screech for Anco Games as a sequel to Kick Off 2 (which made it to the Sega Mega Drive in the altered form of Super Kick Off). VIC Tokai published a version for the Mega Drive in 1994.

Unlike its predecessors, Kick Off 3 had no involvement from lead programmer Dino Dini, and thus plays very differently to other games in the series, having a "horizontal" pitch as opposed to a "vertical" one. Due to these radical changes, the game was met with controversy upon release. Dino Dini released his own football game around the same time for the Amiga titled Goal!, which made its way onto the Mega Drive as Dino Dini's Soccer.</desc>

    <desc>This is a vertical platformer with horizontal wrap-around. For the entertainment of the futuristic masses, you play a criminal that has been inserted into a mechanical body with the promise that if you succeed in surviving through all the levels (there are many and they are hard), you will be set free. You start each level at the bottom, near pooling liquid which will soon rise, at your immediate peril. Navigate the level from bottom to the exit at the top before the liquid rises and kills you. There are many other foes that fly around, causing you damage and basically annoying you to spit. Most levels must be navigated through a series of keyed gates, doors, or portals. These shaped keys are scattered around the map and must by picked up and used only on the gates they match individually. Twist: You can only carry one special weapon (triple shot, laser beam, or vertical shot) and one tool (key, liquid-freeze, or a red herring) at a time. This game requires a lot of memorization of enemy movement patterns and optimum routes. A unique feature is that when you die, you can watch a replay and take over at any point to continue your game. You can also hit the HELP button at the start of each level to view a map, helping you plan your route.</desc>

    <name>King of the Monsters 2 (USA)</name>
    <desc>King of the Monsters 2 on the Sega Genesis is a slightly different game than the original Neo Geo version. While the original let you play one of three different monsters to go through side-scrolling beat'em-up stages and fight (non-playable) monster as boss enemies, the Genesis version was re-worked into a one-on-one fighter similar to the first King of the Monsters game. 

Apart from Farmardy, all characters from the Neo Geo version are playable. To win, the player must defeat all other monsters and a clone of the played monster in a fight. The matches take place in areas built from the original levels, and feature destroyable landscapes and secondary enemies, both of which can be smashed to gain points and power-ups.</desc>

    <desc>Steel Empire (originally released as Koutetsu Teikoku in Japan, and otherwise known in various English materials as The Steel Empire or Empire of Steel), is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up video game released on the Sega Genesis / Mega Drive home consoles in 1992, and was later ported to the Nintendo Game Boy Advance in 2004.

Steel Empire is notable amongst shoot 'em up games for its unique aesthetic designs. Mostly low-tech in nature, with it being set in the late-19th century of an alternate world, the game's aircraft, weaponry, powerups, environments, enemies and bosses are heavily stylized adding strong steampunk elements to the style, themes and visuals of the game. Steam power, propeller-based aircraft, biplanes, dirigibles and heavily-armored steam trains with giant cannons play large roles in the game's protagonists and opponents.</desc>

    <desc>Last Battle is a side-scrolling beat 'em up released for the Sega Mega Drive in 1989 by Sega. It was one of the six launch titles for the U.S. Sega Genesis release. The Japanese version, titled Shin Seikimatsu Kyseishu Densetsu Hokuto no Ken ( ?, "New Legend of the End-of-Century Savior: Fist of the North Star"), is based on the manga series Hokuto no Ken (Fist of the North Star in English). Since the international version did not retain the Hokuto no Ken license, the graphics and characters' names were altered. It was the second Hokuto no Ken game released by Sega, following the Mark III original (released internationally as Black Belt). Versions for the Commodore 64 and Amiga based upon Last Battle were developed and released by Elite in Europe in 1991.</desc>

In order to gain additional funds for the war effort, the Crown raise taxes from the New World colonies without representation. This act compels the New World colonies to protest and boycott against British rule. By 1775, the Crown alarmed by the protests, boycotts and politically instability in the New World sends troops to subdue any rebellious efforts by the New World colonists. This threatening approach provokes the Thirteen Colonies to revolt. Thus starts the War for Independence in the New World (American Revolutionary War).</desc>

There is an exception during the level The Stampede, where Simba is running towards (or in the NES and Game Boy versions, running with the camera looking straight down on top of him) the camera dodging wildebeest and leaping over rocks.
In most versions of the game two bars appear on the HUD. To the left is the roar meter, which must be fully charged for Simba's roar to be effective. To the right is the health bar which decreases when Simba is hurt. At the bottom left of the screen is a counter showing how many lives Simba has remaining. Health can be restored by collecting bugs which come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Some rare health-damaging bugs also exist.
The player controls Simba (first as a cub, then later as an adult) in the main levels and either Timon or Pumbaa in the bonus levels.</desc>

    <name>Madden NFL 96 (USA, Europe)</name>
    <desc>Madden NFL '96 is a football video game designed for the 1995 NFL season, licensed by the NFL . It features John Madden on the cover. The AI has been boosted and can now hurry in two-minute drill situations, spike the ball, and cover the receivers with better efficiency.

Among the innovations in Madden 96, the Create A Player feature was added, which included many position specific mini-games that would determine the ability of the player.

The game also was the first in the Madden series to include secret "classic" teams, which were unlocked by playing any of the 28 pre-expansion NFL franchises in the playoffs and by winning Super Bowl XXX with that team (a rather easy feat as the playoff tournament system allows a player to abort the game while in the lead and still win). The 28 pre-expansion teams were each represented by a classic era equivalent, which ranged from 1960 (Philadelphia Eagles) to 1986 (New York Giants), although all players identified as number-only. Jacksonville Jaguars and Carolina Panthers, having debuted in 1995, did not have a secret classic team revealed in this manner, nor did the All-Madden team. However, Carolina was attached to the blank slate NFLPA team used for Create-A-Player, and Jacksonville and All-Madden hid the "superteams" with players named after the developers; these teams were accessed using unstated cheat codes.</desc>

Neither the Mega Drive or Game Gear versions of S.S. Lucifer: Man Overboard! were released in North America or Japan. They remained exclusives for Europe and Australia.</desc>

This game allows you to sample Indy cars, stock cars and sprint cars, all of which have been graced by Andrettis. The physics are customized to each of these, so expect sprint cars to slide around on the dirt tracks, and the slipstream effect is detectable.

There are 27 computer-controlled cars with individual profiles, and 8 cars to choose from in each race, with varying engine, grip, brakes and pit crew standards.

    <desc>Based of the 1994 movie remake of Frankenstein, the player is the artificial man created by Victor Frankenstein. After Victor rejects his creation due to its hideous appearance, the creation flees from Victor and swears revenge on him.

The player goes through a number of levels, battling anything that attacks with a wooden stick. It's possible to set the tip of the stick on fire, by swinging it at the fire torches located on the walls. The player can also use a special attack: a blue ball coming out of the hands of the creation, which takes some of the player's life away. There are also some simple puzzles to be solved in order to get through the levels.</desc>

    <desc>Mega 6 Vol. 3 is a compilation of Sega Mega Drive/Genesis games released in PAL territories during 1995, and was included as part of the console's late official bundles. The cartridge was the final release in the series of Mega Games compilations, and contains 6 of Sega's most successful games from the early days of the Genesis. It is the only volume of the Mega Games 6 series to introduce a new game to the Mega Games range, and the only Mega Games release to use the shortened Mega 6 title. The game came with individual instruction manuals for each game rather than integrating them all into a single manual. This compilation utilises the standard game selection screen seen in previous Sega compilation releases, including the Mega Games series, Classic Collection and Sonic Classics.</desc>

    <name>MegaPanel (Japan)</name>
    <desc>Megapanel () is a 1990 puzzle game developed and published by Namco (under their Namcot branding) for the Sega Mega Drive. Though initially released only in Japan, the game has made its way to the west through various compilations and consoles with built-in games.

Megapanel is a sliding puzzle game similar to fifteen-tile puzzle games. The aim is to clear as many panels as possible before the pile reaches the top of the screen. In order to clear panels, three or more panels of the same color must be lined up together either vertically or horizontally. Use the D-pad to slide panels (each button indicates what direction to slide to, so the appropriate panel is automatically chosen) and A to bring the next row up immediately. A new life is awarded every 10000 points.</desc>

    <name>Mortal Kombat 3 (Europe)</name>
    <desc>Fed up with continuous losses in tournament battle, Shao Kahn, who had lost to Liu Kang in the Outworld tournament, enacts a 10,000 year-old plan. He would have his Shadow Priests, led by Shang Tsung, revive his former Queen Sindel, who unexpectedly died at a young age. However, she wouldn't be revived in the Outworld. She would be resurrected in the Earthrealm. This would allow Shao Kahn to cross the boundary lines and reclaim his queen.
When Sindel is reincarnated in Earthrealm, Shao Kahn reaches across the dimensions to reclaim her. As a consequence of his action, the Earthrealm becomes a part of the Outworld, instantly stripping billions of their souls. Only a few are spared, as Raiden protects their souls. He tells them that Shao Kahn must be stopped, but he cannot interfere; due to his status, he has no power in Outworld, and Earthrealm is partially merged with Outworld.
Shao Kahn has unleashed extermination squads to roam throughout the Earthrealm and kill any survivors.

Mortal Kombat 3 follows Mortal Kombat II and shares continuity with both Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 and Mortal Kombat Trilogy which were both updates of this game. The next new game in the series was Mortal Kombat 4.</desc>

    <name>Mortal Kombat 3 (USA)</name>
    <desc>Fed up with continuous losses in tournament battle, Shao Kahn, who had lost to Liu Kang in the Outworld tournament, enacts a 10,000 year-old plan. He would have his Shadow Priests, led by Shang Tsung, revive his former Queen Sindel, who unexpectedly died at a young age. However, she wouldn't be revived in the Outworld. She would be resurrected in the Earthrealm. This would allow Shao Kahn to cross the boundary lines and reclaim his queen.
When Sindel is reincarnated in Earthrealm, Shao Kahn reaches across the dimensions to reclaim her. As a consequence of his action, the Earthrealm becomes a part of the Outworld, instantly stripping billions of their souls. Only a few are spared, as Raiden protects their souls. He tells them that Shao Kahn must be stopped, but he cannot interfere; due to his status, he has no power in Outworld, and Earthrealm is partially merged with Outworld.
Shao Kahn has unleashed extermination squads to roam throughout the Earthrealm and kill any survivors. Also, Raiden's protection only extends to the soul, not to the body, so his chosen warriors have to fight the extermination squads and repel Shao Kahn. Eventually with his final defeat, every human on Earthrealm comes back.

    <desc>Following his failure to defeat to Liu Kang in the first Mortal Kombat game, the evil sorcerer Shang Tsung begs his master, Shao Kahn, to spare his life. He tells Shao Kahn that the invitation for Mortal Kombat cannot be turned down, and if they hold it in Outworld, the Earthrealm warriors must attend. Kahn agrees to this plan, and even restores Tsung's youth. He then extends the invitation to Raiden, who gathers his warriors and takes them into Outworld. The new tournament is much more dangerous, as Shao Kahn has the home field advantage, and an Outworld victory will allow him to subdue Earthrealm.</desc>

    <name>Mr. Nutz (Europe)</name>
    <desc>Mr. Nutz is a platform game developed by Ocean for a variety of video games platforms including the Sega Mega Drive in 1994. In the game you take control of Mr. Nutz, who must stop the evil yeti from freezing the world. The Mega Drive version was only released in Europe.

A sequel, titled Mr. Nutz: Hoppin' Mad was released for the Amiga in the following months. It was planned for release on the Sega Mega Drive under the name of Mr. Nutz 2 but was ultimately scrapped despite reportedly being finished (and sent to various magazines for review). Uncompiled source code of the game was leaked in 2009 and compiled into a playable build in 2012.</desc>

    <desc>The gameplay of Ms. Pac-Man is largely identical to that of the original Pac-Man. The player gathers points by eating dots and avoiding ghosts (contact with one loses a life). Power-pellets or energizers change the ghosts, which reverse their course and can be eaten for bonus points. Fruit bonuses can be consumed for increasing point values, twice per level. As the levels increase, the speed and difficulty increase as well.</desc>

    <desc>What would you think if your best friend went on a date with the King of the Dark World - because she thought he was cute?! You'd think she'd been duped - and you'd be right. The fiendish King Rogles stands poised to conquer the other worlds of the universe: the Dream World of Queen Valia, and the Human World. Rogles and his five Dark Lords have taken the force of Yang from Queen Valia and sealed it into a Fantasm Jewel. Only a warrior with a heart perfectly balanced between Yin and Yang can wield the Sword of Valis against the encroaching darkness! Yuko, a young student from the Human World, is the chosen one - and you will control her. She is to become the greatest warrior in the universe, never suspecting that her most fearsome battle will not be against a Dark Lord, but against her closest friend from the Human World - the one she warned, "Don't go out with him, he's the Dark..." But before she could finish, her friend ran off into The Darkness.</desc>

A key feature of NBA Jam was the exaggerated nature of the play - players jumped many times above their own height, making slam dunks that defied both human capabilities and the laws of physics. There were no fouls, free throws, or violations except goaltending and 24 second violations. This meant the player was able to freely shove or elbow his opponent out of the way. Additionally, the game had an "on fire" feature, where if one player made three baskets in a row, he would become "on fire" and have unlimited turbo, no goaltending, and increased shooting ability, until the other team scored (or the player had scored four consecutive baskets while "on fire").</desc>

    <desc>Following F1 Grand Prix Nakajima Satoru, Varie produced another racing simulation using the license. This time the racing is from a first person view aping Super Monaco Grand Prix. The car setup can be modified before you take to the track

There is a Time Attack mode, allowing you to go for as fast a laptime as possible on any of the game's 20 circuits (which include the 16 tracks of the 1992 Formula 1 season), as well as a full season mode, with qualifying and the race itself. Weather can be customised in the Time Attack mode but is randomly chosen in Grand Prix mode, while you can only choose one of the D-tier teams (the 4 weakest of the 16) in grand Prix mode, but can drive for McLaren, Williams et al in Time Attack.</desc>

    <desc>Ninja Burai Densetsu () is a 1991 strategy game by Sega for the Sega Mega Drive released exclusively in Japan.

The game plays similarly to other strategy games such as SystemSoft's Daisenryaku games and Sega's own Shining games. You are in control of a team of ninjas fighting another team. C selects a ninja/confirms an action. B cancels an action, or if no action is in progress, selects the next ninja. A opens the battle menu, which allows you to end your turn. Battles are fully automatic. Unique to Ninja Burai Densetsu are side-scrolling special stages: should you move a ninja onto a special space, they will go into a town where they can get various helpful items from townsfolk.</desc>

    <desc>Sega even had a third project running, this time for the Mega Drive. Once again, the development was done by a third party. This time it seems to have been the mostly unknown developer called Opus, as in-game art and the sound engine used indicate. This game was never released, probably due to quality issues, but a beta copy was leaked and can be played on emulators nowadays. The game would have tried to build on the concept of the original arcade game, but feels to some degree more like a very bad approach to the Streets of Rage school of beat-em-ups. It is obvious that it either was in a rather early development stage, or Sega did right to pull the plug on this botched mess.

The game features a lot of cut scenes, all of them in the finest Engrish. The chapter titles are in Japanese, though. The story doesn't make any sense, at least not in its presented state. Later in the game, you meet people you should know but don't, and about halfway through the game you get to know that your goal from the beginning was to rescue Ryu's kidnapped lady friend.</desc>

    <name>Operation Europe - Path to Victory 1939-45 (USA)</name>
    <desc>Operation Europe: Path to Victory is a multiplatform war game where one or two players can compete in World War II action. The object of the game is to fulfill any one of the military objectives for either the Axis or the Allied forces. Players engage in modern warfare around Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Central Europe, and North Africa.

This game uses abstract numbers and figures in the map view and saves the concrete illustrations of soldiers only when they lock horns on the battlefield or in an urban setting. Urban settings give a traditional 1930s view of housing and office buildings that provide extra protection for units that are guarding them. However, there are massive numbers to crunch and the lack of graphics help enhance the number crunching ability of game's artificial intelligence.</desc>

    <desc>PGA Tour Golf introduced many of the conventions commonly seen in the genre since. The three-click control method (the first to start the swing, the second setting power and over-swing, the third setting draw or fade) allowed for a multitude of different shots, and required a sense of timing.</desc>

    <desc>The sequel to PGA Tour, this game was released solely for the Sega Genesis / Mega Drive along with an alternative version for the Game Gear, as was getting more common for EA sports titles at the time, helping to drive the sales of the 2nd choice console.

This update sees the series add ten professional players to the roster (60 in total) and have the ability to play against them on seven courses and across five tournaments. There is also a new graphics engine in place and new sounds to boot. Statistics became more detailed and the ball physics were improved through a Draw and Fade meter. Game data can be backed up through the built-in battery. Other features include different ball lies, dynamic wind conditions, digitized sounds, an improved automatic caddy and special shots such as chips, punches and fringe putts.</desc>

    <desc>The team at Polygames make some small improvements to the latest PGA title. It has a US setting in terms of the courses and players, unlike PGA European Tour, with 8 courses in total. Control is via the standard method of setting the shot up, then pressing the button once to start a swing, a second time to set the pace, and a third time to set draw/fade. Before taking a shot the club choice, direction and intended draw/fade (spin on the ball) are selected. You can play a 72-hole tournament against 60 other PGA pros, or practice the holes at your leisure.</desc>

    <name>Pac-Attack (USA)</name>
    <desc>On a Tetris-like board the player drops blocks consisting of Ghosts, Blocks, Pac-Men, and one Fairy (if your Fairy Meter is full) to the ground. The objective is to not let the blocks overflow, let Pac-Man eat the ghosts, and make lines to shorten the amount of blocks on the board. When Pac-Man eats a ghost, the Fairy Meter goes up. Once full, a fairy will eventually be dropped. Once the fairy comes to a stop by landing on anything, it waves its wand and every ghost in the eight lines below it will disappear, often resulting in numerous lines being completed and simplifying the board. Once the fairy disappears, the score bonus is given, and gameplay continues.

Pac-Attack can also be played in 2-player mode. Player 1 must eat Blinky, while Player 2 must eat Sue, the purple ghost from Pac-Mania. As players eat ghosts and complete lines, they will drop ghosts on their opponent's board, messing up their board and bringing them closer to the top. This game can even be played in puzzle mode. The object of this mode is to smash all 100 stages. If you get a Game Over, all the regular blocks appear with red crosses on them, while Blinky and Sue over backwards laughing silently. However, you can try the level again.</desc>

    <name>Pac-Man 2 - The New Adventures (USA)</name>
    <desc>In Pac-Man 2, the player plays the role of an observer and assistant that follows Pac-Man as he sets out to accomplish various tasks. Pac-Man himself walks around in a cartoon world and interacts directly with the player, as well as with objects and other characters. The player cannot control Pac-Man directly, but instead can direct his attention in various directions, and is armed with a slingshot that can be used to strike certain objects, including Pac-Man himself.
Pac-Man's mood varies throughout the game, usually in response to his environment or the player's actions, and generally his mood affects his actions and his willingness to cooperate with the player; the varieties of "bad" moods can at time compromise the player's ability to progress. There are a few instances, however, where Pac Man is required to be angry. Hitting objects with the slingshot can often get Pac-Man to look at that object and piece together parts of the puzzle he is currently trying to solve - for example, hitting a door may cause Pac-Man to go inside a house to discover a clue. But beware - a few objects when hit can also produce disastrous (and humorous) results. Hitting a trash can on a city street at the wrong time, for example, can cause a cat to jump out and attack Pac-Man.
Throughout the game, Pac-Man is occasionally harassed by the four ghosts from the classic Pac-Man games. When this happens, Pac-Man is paralyzed by fear and eventually faints, unless the player gives him a power pellet. Then Pac-Man becomes Super Pac-Man for a brief time and flies around, eating the ghosts. In some cases, the ghosts may leave behind important objects.</desc>

    <desc>Pac-Mania is a variation on the game Pac-Man. You need to guide Pac-Man around a maze and eat all of the dots on the board in order to proceed on to the next round. Numerous, multi-colored ghosts also roam the maze trying to stop you. If you eat one of the power pellets in the maze, the ghosts will temporarily turn blue and run from you. Pac-man can earn bonus points by eating the ghosts when they are in this state. The maze is now in 3-D and is larger than screen which will scroll to follow the action. To help get out of tight spots, Pac-Man now has the ability to jump. But be careful, because some of the ghosts have learned this trick as well and you could end up in a mid air collision!</desc>

It is the third game in the Cotton series of so-called "cute-'em-ups" for their unique visual style, and diverts from the gameplay of other Cotton titles. The release packaging included a promotional tea cup, which is now quite rare. Its method of gameplay would be reprised for the Dreamcast Rainbow Cotton.

Willows are special types of candies in a world of witches and fairies. Fairy Queen Velvet starts saying things that don't make sense, and the fairy Silk realizes it is because of monsters who are burning Willows (a burnt one was found near the castle garden). The witch Cotton, who loves eating Willows, conveniently shows up, learns of this, and vows revenge.</desc>

    <desc>The time: Space Century 3240. The place: The Algol Star System. It began when King Lassic turned evil and let hordes of hideous, magical creatures run amok on the three planets. When her brother was killed, Alis vowed to avenge his death and put an end to Lassic forever.

Join her in a journey across time and space to worlds where creatures speak...where magic and science combine to take you on the ultimate video quest.

The battle system is turn-based, allowing the player to choose commands for up to four characters. Each of the eight characters has a different set of preferred weapons and armor, as well as techniques, suited to the character's job. The player must defeat enemies in the overworld and in dungeons to advance in the game.</desc>

    <name>Phantasy Star III - Generations of Doom (Brazil)</name>
    <desc>Phantasy Star III is a sequel to the previous game in the series, Phantasy Star II, although the connections to other games in the Phantasy Star series are not immediately evident. Gameplay is similar to the games before it in the series, with combat still being turn-based and battles randomly occurring. Players must explore both overworld maps and dungeons in order to progress through the game.

Phantasy Star III mostly follows the traditional roleplaying game formula seen throughout the series, with exploration of several 2-D worlds, character recruitment, and random enemy encounters using a turn-based battle system. Unlike previous games, the series staple of "techniques" play a diminished role in combat, which is ironic considering the role they play in differentiating the game's two major factions - with techniques being exclusive to Layans, and viewed as "evil magic" by the Orakians.</desc>

    <name>Pier Solar and the Great Architects (World) (En,Es,Pt) (Rev C) (Unl)</name>
    <desc>Pier Solar and the Great Architects is an independently developed Sega Mega Drive game, released worldwide in December 2010 by WaterMelon, a group of developers from the Mega Drive homebrew and research scene. It is a turn-based RPG, and, at 8 megabytes (64 megabits) in size means it is currently the second largest Sega Mega Drive game available. It is the first internationally commercially released Mega Drive game since 2002's Mega Games 10 (not counting Super Fighter Team's releases, which have all been translations of games released in the 1990s).

The game ships for $35 USD and has a clamshell case with a choice of three cover arts which resemble those used by Sega in Japan, North America and Europe towards the end of the Mega Drive's lifespan. Also included is a 24-page full colour instruction manual and a "MEGA Soundtrack Booster CD", containing the game's soundtrack, which, if the player has a Sega Mega-CD attached, can be used as an alternate source of the game's music during gameplay (however it is not a standalone Mega CD game). 500 "Posterity Packs" were also sold, with buyers receiving their names in the game's credits and instruction booklet.</desc>

Using a side-scrolling view, Pink Panther can jump, duck, run, climb and use a boxing glove to knock out enemies. Additionally, there are special tricks and props such as magic carpets, umbrellas and stairs to reach higher regions. Items such as stoplights, jackhammers, bowling balls, shields and supergloves give an advantage in the battles.

    <desc>Pirates! is a single-player game. The player receives a letter of marque authorizing service as a privateer for Spain, the Dutch Republic, England, or France in the Caribbean. The player's loyalties may change over the course of the game; he may also hold rank with multiple countries and may turn to piracy at any time. Gameplay is open-ended; the player may choose to attack enemy ships or towns, hunt pirates, seek buried treasure, rescue long-lost family members, or even avoid violence altogether and seek to increase his wealth through trade. The game also has no predetermined end, although as time goes on, it becomes more difficult to recruit crew members. Also, as the player character ages, fighting becomes more difficult, and deteriorating health will eventually force the character into retirement. The game ends when the player retires, at which point he is given a position in his future life, from beggar to King's adviser, based on accumulated wealth, land, rank, marital status, and other accomplishments.</desc>

    <desc>The player begins Pit-Fighter by choosing one of the three playable characters, who all have different moves, speed, and power. As many as three people can play at a time, but there will be extra opponents to fight during any of this game's 15 different matches.
Every third fight is known as a Grudge Match. In a Grudge Match, the player must fight against a CPU controlled clone of his or her fighter (if playing alone) or the other players in a multiplayer game. Each player has three "knockdowns" - getting knocked down three times eliminates them from the Grudge Match, the winner is the last man standing. This match plays more like a bonus round, in that there is only results are gaining or failing to gain bonus money, and losing the Grudge Match does not eliminate a player.
The final battle, the "Championship Match", is between the player and the mysterious entity that taunts between matches every once in a while, the Masked Warrior. If more than one person is playing the game before this match, they must fight each other to the death until only one becomes victorious and can fight him.

The player must jump, punch, and kick their opponent until his/her energy runs out. If the player presses all three of the buttons at a time, the character will perform a "super move".
Sometimes during matches the player will come across foreign objects such as knives, crates, sticks, motorcycles, and bar stools that can be thrown at you or your opponent. The player may also come across a power-up known as the "power pill". If the player or the opponent grab this item, one will become temporarily stronger and take less damage from hits.
Sometimes even the crowd will interfere in the fights. Two characters, known as Knife Man and Knife Woman, will come out of the crowd and stab the player with their daggers. The player can take these nuisances out with one hit. Sometimes there is also a fat bearded man with a stick. If the player knocks him down, the player can take the stick and use it against the current opponent.
The audience will also push any fighter that ends up among them, and stays there more than a few seconds. They will be forced back into the fighting area.</desc>

    <desc>In Primal Rage, a meteor strike has devastated the Earth; technology has ceased to exist, civilization has been utterly reduced to rubble, and humans have regressed into tribes of Stone Age dwellers. Into this new radiation-scarred world, primitively referred to as "Urth", primordial rainforest has covered the land and numerous new species have evolved.
Out of their ranks seven creatures emerge who wage war for control over the new world; they are torn between those who wish to keep peace on Urth, and those who attempt to plunge the world into further chaos for their own benefit. These creatures have otherworldly or supernatural abilities. The Primal Rage trading cards that were distributed along with the toyline presented each creature as a god of an aspect of nature, as in life and death, fire and ice. There are four of the good Virtuous Gods and three evil Destructive Gods. The character Sauron, God of Hunger, is marked as a "Virtuous Beast" despite the fact that his in-game ending displays an image of him devouring humans. In fact, the creatures eating humans is a basic part of the gameplay.</desc>

Try to escape from the dungeon, take out Jaffar's guards, find your way through the Sultan's palace and defeat Jaffar himself. Now go, you've got 60 minutes!

Prince of Persia is a 2D platformer with run and jump gameplay. Your hero must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple puzzles and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the game within an hour.

The standalone game was exclusively released in Japan until 2000, when Sega ported it to the Neo Geo Pocket Color under the name Puyo Pop in the US/Europe (unrelated to the GBA Puyo Pop Minna de Puyo Puyo)  making it the first Puyo Puyo game to be released outside Japan unaltered (and establishing the Puyo Puyo/Puyo Pop naming discretion still used today). It was also included as the Classic mode of Puyo Pop Fever and later rereleased on the Virtual Console's Import section (albeit untranslated).

Sega also produced a port to Bandai's WonderSwan handheld.

The Mega Drive version was the first MD game to use the new Saturn-style box layout in the JP region.</desc>

So far the game has never been released outside of Japan (and South Korea).

Like Tant-R, Ichidant-R is a series of timed minigames, represented in the graphical style seen in Bonanza Bros.. Ichidant-R was bundled with Quiz Rouka ni Tattensai! in Sega Ages Rouka ni Ichidant-R for the Sega Saturn, and it was also bundled with Tant-R as part of volume 6 in the Sega Ages 2500 series for the PlayStation 2. It was also released for the Wii's Virtual Console service in 2007.

One final game in the Puzzle &amp; Action series, Puzzle &amp; Action: Treasure Hunt was released for Sega Titan Video arcade hardware in 1997.</desc>

    <desc>While Donald is flipping through some books in Uncle Scrooge's library, a treasure map from King Garuzia, the old-time ruler of the Great Duck kingdom, falls out. It leads to the king's most prized possession. Donald thinks this is his path to riches. Unfortunately Big Bad Pete overhears and pursues Donald throughout the game hoping to steal the treasure.

Donald, using a partial map from the library, travels to a variety of places around the world seeking clues to find the treasure, including Duckburg and Mexico. After defeating Count Dracula in Transylvania, Donald receives a more complete map pointing to the Maharajah in India, Egypt, a haunted Viking ship, and finally the South Pole, where Donald finds an ancient Viking diary said to reveal the location of the treasure. However, upon finding the diary, Pete shows up, holding Donald's nephews hostage in exchange for the diary. After giving Pete the diary, Donald travels to Pete's hideout to defeat Pete and get the diary back. The diary reveals that the map, when dipped in water, will reveal the location of the Great Duck Treasure.

After evading the traps and defeating the ancient spirit guarding the treasure, Donald enters the treasure vault, only to find a simple stone statue. He is disappointed, but Huey, Dewey and Louie accidentally break the statue, which reveals a golden jeweled necklace was hidden inside. Donald gives the necklace to Daisy and the two fly off into the sunset together.</desc>

    <desc>R.B.I. Baseball '94 refines the engine used in 1993's game by doubling the speed of play, updating player movement with rotoscoped animation, and adding new music and sound effects, including the voice of award-winning broadcaster Jack Buck. You can also play a full 162-game season complete with playoffs and world championships, although a password is required to continue progress. Eight hundred actual players (with stats based on the 1993 season) have been added with colorful portraits appearing whenever they step up to the plate. Despite the game not having a Major League Baseball license, all 28 teams from 1993 are represented by city name and ballparks have been modeled after authentic stadiums. Also featured are the rosters for every division winner since 1985 as well as the 1989-93 All-Star squads. Game modes include: Home Run Derby, Game Breakers, Practice, Single Game, Season and Create Teams.</desc>

    <name>Ragnacenty (Korea)</name>
    <desc>Crusader of Centy in the US, Soleil in Europe, Shin Souseiki Ragnacenty () in Japan, and Ragnacenty in Korea, is an adventure game developed by Nextech under contract from Sega in 1994 for the Sega Mega Drive. The game was translated to Korean (released 1995), English, French, German, and Spanish. The North American release was localized and published by Atlus. The game's music was composed by Motokazu Shinoda, a professional Japanese concert pianist and composer (sound programmer Noriyuki Iwadare is often miscredited as co-composer)

Soleil is a village in a large continent overrun by monsters, and the crusaders of Soleil are sent out by the King to save the humans. While on your own quest, you save an old lady who tells you to talk to a fortuneteller west of Soleil, who exchanges your ability to talk to humans with the ability to talk to animals (for the first half of the game, that is). Now, you must rely on your sword and the aid of a group of animals to rid the world of monsters  though along the way, you'll come to realize monsters aren't as evil as the humans make them out to be.</desc>

    <desc>Rainbow Islands Extra ( ) is a strange update to Rainbow Islands: The Story of Bubble Bobble 2, released by Taito for arcades in 1988 before being ported to the Sega Mega Drive in 1990 exclusively in Japan.

Although it offers a port of the original Rainbow Islands, the default option is the "extra" mode, in which all the cute and colourful enemies found in the original game are replaced with enemies found in Taito's shoot-'em-up series, Darius. The music in extra mode has also been replaced with tunes from that game. The rules are otherwise the same as in the original - create rainbows to defeat enemies and reach the top of the screen.

The story for both modes is the same: Bubby's friends have been captured and turned into Bubble Dragons by Super Skull Monsta [sic], and Bubby needs to save them by destroying the Super Skull Monsta's minions with rainbows and collecting Little Diamonds to get Magical Mirrors needed to break the spell.

Rainbow Islands Extra was only released in Japan.</desc>

    <name>Red Zone (USA, Europe)</name>
    <desc>Red Zone is a helicopter action shooter in which you pilot an AH-64B Apache into the heart of enemy territory to thwart the plans of a nuclear armed dictator. Under threat of global nuclear war the dictator has begun to annex his neighbor countries, with plans to continue his territorial expansion, so three special operatives are covertly sent in with a lone gunship to remove his ability to wage war.

The majority of the game consists of air-to-ground attack while flying in the Apache, using its hefty loadout of rockets, guided missiles, built-in 30 mm cannon and defensive infrared air-to-air missiles in order to eliminate the hostiles from the air, land and sea. Fuel drums, repair kits and ammunition depletion are both factors to keep in mind, and careful planning of where the pickups are located so that the chopper is able to stay in the air and is able to keep fighting, elements that are very similar in implementation to the Strike series. Differences between the games include the fact that as your systems get damaged, your helicopter becomes harder to control and the weapon and radar systems become affected.</desc>

    <name>Rent a Hero (Japan)</name>
    <desc>Rent A Hero () (also incorrectly named Rent-A-Hero; Sega has never used hyphens in the game's romanized name) is a Japan-exclusive RPG developed by Sega AM2 for the Sega Mega Drive in 1991 with a large emphasis on humour. It follows Taro Yamada (or "Rent A Hero"), a hero for hire that needs to complete various tasks to save the day.

The game borrows the engine used in Phantasy Star III, however instead of turn-based battles enemies are defeated through a versus-fighting system similar to Street Fighter II.

Though mostly unknown to the western world, Rent A Hero has been referenced several times across Sega products, including Fighters Megamix in which Taro is an unlockable character.

The game was remade for the Sega Dreamcast as Rent A Hero No.1. It has also been re-released as part of the Wii's Virtual Console service in Japan.</desc>

    <desc>This early version is different from its PC counterpart with this version featuring six different stages to choose from and each with their own type of gameplay:Bruno's Deli: The player takes control of Huckle the Cat as they help Bruno serve his customers by selecting the items they have requested on a conveyor belt.

- Captain Salty: The player uses Huckle again and uses a crane to piece together Salty's ship by dropping them in the required spot which is marked.

- Building House: This is essentially the same as Captain Salty's stage, except this time around the player is building a house instead of a ship.

- Delivery Truck: The player uses Huckle and Lowly Worm to deliver various objects to their required shops while avoiding various obstacles such as trashcans, crossing chickens and chairs to name a few.

- Fire Station: This time the player takes control of a pig fire fighter and transverse BusyTown in a fire truck, collecting various firefighter-related objects while avoiding obstacles. After each object is collected, the player is then taken to a house fire where they must put out the fire and rescue the trapped animals inside.

- The Wind: The player can become the wind and shown a top-down map of BusyTown and using a whirlwind can interact with various objects on the screen to view animations.
Additionally, the player can choose these different locations at the main screen that has the player become Lowly the Worm and fly around the map using his Apple Helicopter. It also features many the characters from Scarry's educational books.</desc>

    <desc>Band together six powerful magicians and search out the fabled Rings of Power to free your world. Interact and trade with inhabitants of thirty cities. Over 100 animated spells to choose from!

Rings of Power is quite different from traditional console RPGs gameplay-wise, and is more similar to Western-style games such as Ultima series. You can freely wander through the huge isometric world, and are not obliged to follow any storyline except the main quest for the eleven rings. You can talk to NPCs about many topics, choose whom to fight, bribe people, etc. There is a day/night cycle which affects the behavior of characters. Unlike most RPGs, there are no weapons and armor in this game. The turn-based combat is entirely dependent on magic spells. On your journey you will encounter characters from several guilds, each proficient in his own type of magic, and make them join your party.</desc>

    <desc>Unusually for Electronic Arts in the early 90s, this was a platform -shooter game with little or no adventuring or strategy elements. The game scrolls sideways, and has sections where precision jumps are required, either to clear rivers or collect bonuses. You carry a dagger to deal with the enemies, and must avoid contact with them. When killed, they leave coins to be collected - these are spent in the shop sections. Death loses you most of your coins, but they can usually be retrieved if they land on solid ground - making it better to be killed in combat than by drowning.</desc>

An evil space pirate, Kaiser Greedy, has made the planets' leaders obey him. The inhabitants of Planet Neer (Flora outside Japan) pray for a hero before Greedy's mind control snatches them. The desperate prayers reach the nebula of the Star Goddess, Oruto. She awakens one of her children, Ristar, with the sole purpose of granting the wishes of the innocent people. He must stop Greedy and the brainwashed leaders of each world in the galaxy, to restore peace to the galaxy.

In Mega Drive versions outside Japan, Oruto is not seen. Instead, Ristar has a father figure, the Legendary Hero, who is a shooting star that protects the Valdi System. Rather than Oruto awakening Ristar, the Legendary Hero was kidnapped by Greedy, and it is up to Ristar to rescue his father as well. However, Oruto is still seen in the Game Gear version.</desc>

    <desc>RoboCop 3 is a side-scrolling platform shooter. You get missions (such as rescuing your colleagues who are being kept hostages), which are divided into several smaller levels. The levels usually consist of several platforms, and are heavily populated by enemies who shoot at you. You can gather special repair kits, which will be used to restore your health after you've completed a level. "RoboCop 3" is more of a shooter than its predecessors, having more and tougher enemies.</desc>

The next thing you remember you are rummaging through scrap metal and welding together steel to make parts for weapons. You have become a cyborg slave in a munitions factory for the Cydrek Federation, a twisted machine with a human brain, unable to comprehend your situation, clouded by cybernetic programming until one day your human side finally starts to break through. You remember everything and realize that the Cydrek Federation is building an army to take on the G.U.A. and you must stop it.

RTK can be said to be much more 'stable' where players no longer have to worry that much about time length in the game, as the game take a slower time rate to allow the players to build up their forces without much interference.

As they go deeper and deeper they will find clues as to who ordered the kidnapping, the Sakazaki family's relation to the mob, and a person from their past.

This fighting game is a coin-op conversion of the Neo-Geo hit of the same name, and has all characters, stages, and moves featured in the arcade unit. Unlike the original arcade version, players can now play as Mr. Big and the elusive Mr. Karate.

The gameplay differs from most fighting games. In this game, you have a Spirit meter. A Spirit meter is in the game and will decrease as you perform special moves. It can be recharged, but doing so leaves you open to attack. When your health is almost gone, you can perform a secret combination that will unleash a deadly attack on your opponent - provided you have a full Spirit meter.</desc>

The game concept is still the same, though they did improve a lot of features that one may consider 'disturbing' from RTK I (e.g. Generals dying easily due to disease, etc.). RTK can be said to be much more 'stable' where players no longer have to worry that much about time length in the game, as the game take a slower time rate to allow the players to build up their forces without much interference. The RTK II gameplay and interface is closely similar to Nobunaga's Ambition II.</desc>

    <desc>Sansan () is an online service allowing people living in Japan to play the abstract strategy board game Go with other subscribers over the internet on a Windows PC. However, at its launch in 1994, a version for the Sega Mega Drive was also made available. This version of the game allows players who have a Sega Mega Modem to connect over a 33.3kbps or ISDN line to play other members who have a Sansan ID. However, as of 2011, there are no known Mega Drive-compatible Sansan servers. A local two-player version of the game is also included for play.

For whatever reason, the Mega Drive version did not last very long  it is one of the rarest and most sought-after Mega Drive games; Sega of Japan's official archive doesn't list it (despite Sansan Co., Ltd. having T-series code T-147) and a ROM was not dumped until February 2011. The Windows PC version of the service continues to this day.</desc>

    <name>SeaQuest DSV (Europe)</name>
    <desc>Based on the first season of the TV series of the same name, your character is an officer of the UEO: The United Earth Oceans Organization. You begin the game inside a training simulation, which upon successful completion ensures your transfer to the crew of the seaQuest DSV where you will be called upon to perform the same duties.

Primarily, your function is to navigate the seaQuest Deep Submergence Vessel around the underwater map to various 'mission areas' where you will be called upon to use the on board vehicles to accomplish some task. Typical missions include salvage operations, rescue operations, disarmament of underwater explosives, termination of enemies and exploration. Damage of underwater property is deducted from your budget and completion of objectives adds to it. The money must be used to resupply weapons and buy additional vehicles. Underwater is a dangerous place.

The vehicles you have at your command includeSpeeder: A simple two-man vessel designed entirely for speed. It is also a combat vessel and may fire forwards, move up &amp; down and change orientation between facing left and facing right
Stinger: A prototype "next generation" attack vessel, this one-man sub allows you to orientate in any direction to fire your weapon accurately.
Sea Crab: A slow vehicle used for excavation, mining, and rescue missions. It is the only vessel that can dock with other vessels and one of only two that can pick up undersea objects for transport. It comes with a water jet to clear debris and a retractable drill
Sea Truck: Slow and bulky, this vessel may move up and down and change it's orientation between left and right. It's weapons are torpedoes and mines which may be dropped behind it. Furthermore it can also pick up undersea objects for transport
Remote (HR) Probe: Small and agile, this vehicle contains only a very simple weapon. It's main purpose however is underwater welding and repair of objects. It can also activate switches
Darwin - Intelligent Dolphin and seaQuest mascot: Darwin the Dolphin is perhaps the most agile of the vehicles, and may take off in bursts of speed. However Darwin has no weapons with which to defend himself and is very vulnerable. Darwin is able to get into tiny spaces that none of the other vehicles can reach. Darwin is able to activate switches.</desc>

    <desc>The Second Samurai is a beat-em-up developed by Vivid Image and Psygnosis and released exclusively in Europe for the Commodore Amiga (1993) and Sega Mega Drive (1994). It is the sequel to The First Samurai, a beat-em-up released for various home computers and the SNES internationally a few years prior.

You play as one of two Samurais (the 1-player mode has the male protagonist from The First Samurai only; the 2-player mode lets the second player control a new female Samurai). A and B both attack depending on what weapon you have equipped right now (only one at a time, some in limited quantities), what enemies/objects are nearby, and which D-pad buttons you are holding at the time. C jumps. A screen at the beginning of the game (also accessible from the Options menu) shows you what each in-game item does for you.

A Sega Mega-CD port was advertised, but never released.</desc>

    <desc>The gameplay remains basically unchanged from the Shadow Dancer coin-op game, the Mega Drive features all new stages and bosses, and a slightly different objective: instead of looking for time bombs, the player must now rescue hostages scattered around each stage before facing the boss. The bonus rounds were also changed from a first-person minigame to one in which the player must shoot down ninjas below them while skydiving from a building.</desc>

    <desc>Shadow of the Beast II finds the hero in half-beast form, wandering the lands of Karamoon in search of his kidnapped sister. She had been taken away from her mother's cottage by the dragon-form of the Beast Mage, Zelek, servant to Maletoth. Along the way, Aarbron befriends the wise dragon Barloom and must defeat the evil dragon Ishran. Tree Pygmies in the forest and the goblins in the Crystal Caverns serve as interactive, complicated foes. For example, a bottle of booze picked up at the Karamoon oasis must be given to the goblin jailer to free Aarbron from his cell. Only after Aarbron gives the old man his ring and his parchment does he obtain a spell powerful enough to harm Zelek.</desc>

    <desc>Shove It! follows a burly warehouse worker, whose aspiration is to earn enough money to buy an expensive car and impress the ladies. What must this worker do? Move boxes.

The worker is placed in a special grid, and there are only a few different types of blocks: movable crates, locations for crates, and barriers. Crates can only be pushed, not pulled, and only one at a time. The object of each stage is to move each crate to one of the designates spots where crates must be placed. When this is complete, the worker progresses. There is a multitude of stages, grouped in clusters of ten apiece.</desc>

    <desc>Shikinjoh or Shi Kin Joh or Shi-Kin-Joh or Shikinjou (or likewise) () is a 1989/1990 puzzle game by Scap Trust for the NEC PC-88 and NEC PC-98. Sunsoft ported it to the Sega Mega Drive and Sega Game Gear in 1991, with the Mega Drive version having added Sega Mega Modem capabilities. No version has left Japan. A version was later included with Sunsoft's Game no Tetsujin The Shanghai for the Sega Saturn.

The goal of the game is to force your way to the exit by pushing mahjong tiles around. When two tiles with the same image meet, they disappear. Some tiles cannot be moved. You can only push tiles forward in the direction you are facing. C/2 goes back one move. A/1 opens a menu with various options. The Mega Drive version has several gameplay modes; the Game Gear version only has standard levels and a password system.</desc>

    <desc>Crusader of Centy in the US, Soleil in Europe, Shin Souseiki Ragnacenty () in Japan, and Ragnacenty in Korea, is an adventure game developed by Nextech under contract from Sega in 1994 for the Sega Mega Drive. The game was translated to Korean (released 1995), English, French, German, and Spanish. The North American release was localized and published by Atlus. The game's music was composed by Motokazu Shinoda, a professional Japanese concert pianist and composer (sound programmer Noriyuki Iwadare is often miscredited as co-composer)

Soleil is a village in a large continent overrun by monsters, and the crusaders of Soleil are sent out by the King to save the humans. While on your own quest, you save an old lady who tells you to talk to a fortuneteller west of Soleil, who exchanges your ability to talk to humans with the ability to talk to animals (for the first half of the game, that is). Now, you must rely on your sword and the aid of a group of animals to rid the world of monsters  though along the way, you'll come to realize monsters aren't as evil as the humans make them out to be.</desc>

    <desc>Shining Force II is a tactical role-playing game. The player assumes the role of the Shining Force leader, Bowie. When not in combat, the player can explore towns and other locales, talk with people, and set the members and equipment of the army. Some towns have a headquarters where the player can inspect and talk with his allies. While roaming through town or moving throughout the world, one can find both visible and hidden treasures and interact with certain objects.
Each ally unit is represented by a character with a background and personality. Some of these characters are hidden, requiring specific events to occur before they will join the force. Each ally unit also has a class, which defines the abilities for that unit. These abilities range from what type of weapons they can use to what kind of spells they can learn. Units can become stronger by fighting enemies and performing various actions which gives them experience points (EXP), which allow them to gain levels. Once a unit reaches level 20, that character has the ability to advance to more powerful class through promotion. Some characters have two different classes they may be promoted to, one of which is only accessible using a special hidden item.
Battles take place on a square grid, and each unit occupies a single square. Battle is turn-based. Each turn, a character can move and perform one action: either attack, cast a spell, or use an item. Some commands, such as equipping or dropping an item during the turn, do not count as actions.
The battle is won if all enemies are defeated, or if the enemy commander is defeated. If Bowie is defeated in combat or withdraws, the battle is lost and the player is returned to the nearest town, where he can recover his allies and fight the same battle again.</desc>

The game consists of story line interaction, dungeon exploration, random monster fights, and predetermined 'boss' fights.

Monster encounters happen randomly during dungeon exploration at which point turn-based combat proceeds.
Additionally, the dungeon contains three characters in need of rescue. Rescuing any or all of the three is optional, and the story changes depending on whether or not the player locates and returns each of these characters to safety.</desc>

    <desc>Shove It! follows a burly warehouse worker, whose aspiration is to earn enough money to buy an expensive car and impress the ladies. What must this worker do? Move boxes.

The worker is placed in a special grid, and there are only a few different types of blocks: movable crates, locations for crates, and barriers. Crates can only be pushed, not pulled, and only one at a time. The object of each stage is to move each crate to one of the designates spots where crates must be placed. When this is complete, the worker progresses. There is a multitude of stages, grouped in clusters of ten apiece.</desc>

    <desc>Bart vs. The Space Mutants is a platform game where the player goes into the role of Bart Simpson (from the TV show The Simpsons) and must stop the Space Mutants from invading Springfield.

On each of the five levels, Bart must collect (or get rid of) the ingredients that the Space Mutants are planning to use to build their machine, such as purple objects or balloons. He also has to collect enough "proof" of the aliens existence (brown coins left behind when they are jumped on), so his family members will help him when he meets a boss (characters such as Nelson and Sideshow Bob). This won't be easy since the Space Mutants are "using" human bodies as disguise. In order to discover who are the real Space Mutants, Bart must use his X-ray Specs.

The ways Bart can get rid of those objects sought by the Space Mutants are numerous. For instance, in the first stage, Bart must get rid of purple objects. He can dye them red, cover them, wash them, etc. Some even involve a little puzzle solving, like playing a trick on Moe to make him get out of the bar.</desc>

The game was translated to Korean (released 1995), English, French, German, and Spanish. The North American release was localized and published by Atlus.

Soleil is a village in a large continent overrun by monsters, and the crusaders of Soleil are sent out by the King to save the humans. While on your own quest, you save an old lady who tells you to talk to a fortuneteller west of Soleil, who exchanges your ability to talk to humans with the ability to talk to animals (for the first half of the game, that is). Now, you must rely on your sword and the aid of a group of animals to rid the world of monsters  though along the way, you'll come to realize monsters aren't as evil as the humans make them out to be.</desc>

    <name>Sonic &amp; Knuckles (World)</name>
    <desc>The story picks up from the ending of Sonic 3 - Dr. Robotnik's orbital weapon, the Death Egg, has been badly damaged in the climactic battle between himself and Sonic The Hedgehog. As the satellite falls back to the Floating Island, landing in a volcanic crater, Sonic jumps off, landing in a mushroom filled woodland.
Sonic knows there are many Chaos Emeralds hidden on the island, including the powerful Super Emeralds and the Master Emerald, the secret to the island's levitation powers. Worried that Robotnik may try to harness this power to fuel a repaired Death Egg, he sets off to try and destroy the Death Egg once and for all, keeping an eye out for Knuckles the Echidna, still smarting from his Launch Base defeat.
At Hidden Palace, Sonic finds Knuckles there waiting for him. They fight and Sonic seems to emerge victorious when Knuckles flees from the duel after sensing someone is trying to steal the Master Emerald. Knuckles races ahead closely followed by Sonic to find Robotnik trying to steal the Master Emerald: It had been his plan all along to snatch it while Sonic and Knuckles were too busy dealing with each other. Realizing he had been tricked, Knuckles reacts by attacking Robotnik, which fails when Robotnik electrocutes Knuckles. Sonic tries to intervene but Robotnik stills manages to escape. Knuckles now realizes his mistake and that Sonic is in fact on his side. They join forces and teleport to Sky Sanctuary.
At Sky Sanctuary, Knuckles and Sonic watch the Death Egg launching in the background. Knuckles activates a bridge so Sonic can cross over. Sonic defeats a rebuilt Metal Sonic on the way to the Death Egg, and manages to board it before it leaves the atmosphere. Onboard the Death Egg, Sonic defeats Robotnik and destroys the ship once and for all, only for Robotnik to get away with the Master Emerald in one of his giant robots. If Sonic hasn't collected all seven Chaos Emeralds and/or Super Emeralds, the game ends here, and the ending in which the Master Emerald does not return to Angel Island occurs. After the credits, the player sees a scene with Robotnik still in possession of the Master Emerald.
If all the seven Chaos Emeralds and/or Super Emeralds are collected, Sonic transforms into Super Sonic or Hyper Sonic and chases Robotnik into the Doomsday Zone. After failing to lose him in an asteroid belt, Robotnik's machine is destroyed, Sonic and Tails return the Master Emerald, and the Floating Island becomes airborne once again. If the player didn't collect all the Super Emeralds, a scene occurs which shows an Egg Robo emerging from a pile of metal. If all Emeralds are collected, the player sees the Sonic 3 and Knuckles logo featuring Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles.</desc>

    <desc>Dr. Robotnik has assumed control of Mt. Mobius and turned it into a mechanical base. Utilizing energy produced by the magma flowing under the volcano, this new monstrosity (the Veg-O-Fortress) has the power to transform helpless animals into robot slaves at an astounding rate. Sonic the Hedgehog and Tails fly onto the scene to mount an aerial assault, but Sonic is knocked off the wings of Tails' airplane by a blast from the fortress. He falls into the water, but is rescued and taken to the subterranean levels of the Veg-O-Fortress. The fortress must be destroyed from the inside-out, and the only way to make that happen is to trigger an eruption in the volcano it's built on. Sonic knows this can be done by removing the Chaos Emeralds that keep the volcano stable. Robotnik, however, is also aware of the fragile relationship that exists between the Emeralds and the mountain, and he's set up an elaborate Pinball Defense System to make sure the precious jewels don't go anywhere.</desc>

    <desc>Sorcerian () is the fifth main game in Falcom's Dragon Slayer series of RPGs, first released for the NEC PC-88 in 1987 before being ported to a variety of other systems. Sega ported it to the Sega Mega Drive in 1990  this port was not released outside Japan (the IBM PC port was the only port of the time to be released outside Japan, published by Sierra) and unlike the other Mega Drive Dragon Slayer games, is not a product of the later Sega Falcom partnership.

In the main series, Sorcerian was followed by Dragon Slayer: Eiyuu Densetsu. However, as with other main series entries, Sorcerian received a number of its own sequels on Japanese home computers, including the Dreamcast game Sorcerian: Shichisei Mahou no Shito.</desc>

    <desc>In the year 6236, Harrier once again receives a call for help, this time from the 214th sector, light-years from his cruiser. Harrier travels there quickly with his "cosmic gate", and finds that Fantasy Land is in overrun by hostile forces. He resolves to once again save a world by fighting off the entire force himself.

There are a total of 12 stages, each with its own end boss. A stage usually consists of different landscapes (small objects vs. large objects), and can also move at different speeds (slow vs fast). Some stages, such as Stuna Area, have a mid-level boss that can be easily defeated. Although the player can select any stage to start the game at, all twelve levels must be completed before moving on to the Final Chapter stage. It is here that the player must defeat all the main bosses over again, and then fight the Dark Harrier.</desc>

    <desc>In the first level, the player controls Spider-Man who must use his spider sense to disarm several bombs located throughout the immediate exterior and maze-like entrance to an abandoned building. After the player completes this level Spider-Man learns that the evil Arcade has kidnapped Storm, Cyclops, Wolverine, and Gambit. The player must successfully complete each character's level (each set in Arcade's deadly "Murderworld") in order to get to control Spider-Man in a final battle with Arcade.

After completing each stage, the player controls each hero as they fight in similar-designed mini-levels themed after the "Behind-the-Scenes" of Murderworld. The only character to have a significant change is Storm, who now walks, shoots multiple bolts of lightning rapidly and calls upon gusts of wind, and jumps about four times the height of the other characters. The last level takes place inside a large room, where Arcade chases Spider-Man back and forth in a large Arcade-shaped robot, which operates like a Matryoshka Doll, until Arcade is finally defeated. The X-Men stand-by at the edges of the room, occasionally attacking on their own.</desc>

    <desc>Squirrel King is an unlicensed platform game developed for the Sega Mega Drive. It was published and developed by Gamtec, and therefore its origin is Taiwan.

Squirrel King is extremely similar to Capcom's Chip 'N Dale: Rescue Rangers and it sequel, Chip 'N Dale: Rescue Rangers 2 for the NES, to the point where the player actually plays as two characters named "Chip" and "Dale" (though they look slightly different to their Disney counterparts). C jumps, B picks up and throws crates, and A allows Chip or Dale to throw fireballs, assuming they have some in their inventory.

Squirrel King is the basis for another unlicensed title, Super Mario World, also for the Mega Drive,but developed by Chuanpu and possibly published by Ming Super Chip Electronic</desc>

Two prototypes were independently discovered by drx and by Brandon Cobb, head of Super Fighter Team, who subsequently acquired a license to complete the translation from HOT-B successor company Starfish (who like to revisit old properties), with intentions on releasing it on the twentieth anniversary of the original release. Despite his PR claiming that he received an "unofficial license" from Sega to distribute the game, Sega really asked him to remove their copyrights and trademarks, consequently making the translation fully unlicensed (while Blue Almanac is fully licensed).</desc>

    <name>Starflight (USA, Europe) (v1.1)</name>
    <desc>Starflight is a space exploration, trading, and combat video game developed by Binary Systems and published by Electronic Arts in 1986. Originally developed for IBM compatible and Tandy systems, it was later released for the Amiga, Atari ST, Macintosh and Commodore 64. A fully revamped version of the game was developed for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis in 1991.

Set in the year 4620, the game puts players in the role of a starship captain sent to explore the galaxy. There is no set path, allowing players to switch freely between mining, ship-to-ship combat, and alien diplomacy. The broader plot of the game emerges slowly, as the player discovers that an ancient race of beings is causing stars to flare and destroy all living creatures.

The game has been widely praised by both contemporary and modern critics, and is one of the earliest instances of a sandbox game. It led to the development of a sequel, Starflight 2: Trade Routes of the Cloud Nebula, and influenced the design of numerous other games for decades after its release.</desc>

    <desc>Steel Empire (originally released as Koutetsu Teikoku in Japan, and otherwise known in various English materials as The Steel Empire or Empire of Steel), is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up video game released on the Sega Genesis / Mega Drive home consoles in 1992, and was later ported to the Nintendo Game Boy Advance in 2004.

Steel Empire is notable amongst shoot 'em up games for its unique aesthetic designs. Mostly low-tech in nature, with it being set in the late-19th century of an alternate world, the game's aircraft, weaponry, powerups, environments, enemies and bosses are heavily stylized adding strong steampunk elements to the style, themes and visuals of the game. Steam power, propeller-based aircraft, biplanes, dirigibles and heavily-armored steam trains with giant cannons play large roles in the game's protagonists and opponents.</desc>

    <desc>The player engages opponents in one-on-one close quarter combat in a series of best-two-out-of-three matches. The objective of each round is to deplete the opponent's vitality before the timer runs out. If both opponents knock each other out at the same time or the timer runs out with both fighters having an equal amount of vitality left, then a "double KO" or "draw game" is declared and additional rounds will be played until sudden death. In the first Street Fighter II, a match could last up to ten rounds if there was no clear winner; this was reduced to four rounds in Champion Edition and onward. If there is no clear winner by the end of the final round, then either the computer-controlled opponent will win by default in a single-player match or both fighters will lose in a 2-player match.</desc>

    <name>Street Racer (Europe)</name>
    <desc>Street Racer is a racing game developed by Vivid Image and published by Ubisoft for numerous consoles and computers including the Sega Mega Drive and Sega Saturn. Similar to Super Mario Kart, the game allows the user to select one of many cartoon-like characters, racing around a circuit, avoiding obstacles and using special items.

Due to various hardware restrictions, gameplay differs among platforms - the Mega Drive version of the game has the player travel along a road in a similar manner to Hang On or OutRun, whereas the Saturn version renders its levels through 3D geometry, allowing the user to see more of the stage. The Japanese Saturn version of the game is called Street Racer Extra () due to these additions.

The Mega Drive version of the game was not released in Japan or North America, though did make it to Brazil and Europe. Plans for a North American version were put in place (even getting to the stage of having its own box art with ESRB rating), but were cancelled. Likewise the Saturn version of the game was not released in North America.</desc>

The game is played from a side-scrolling third person perspective in which you can move in any direction in a closed arena (limited by the cheering crowds and other street elements). You have to face eight unique fighters in succession by using punches, kicks, and jumping against the progressively more difficult adversaries.</desc>

    <desc>A year has passed since the events of Streets of Rage. To celebrate the defeat of the mysterious "Mr. X" and his syndicate the previous year, Adam Hunter, Axel Stone, and Blaze Fielding met at their favorite nightspot in the city and spent their time reminiscing about their vigilante crusade against "Mr. X" and his organization. Axel and Blaze had moved out of the city after the adventure from last year. Axel has begun working as a part-time bodyguard and Blaze teaches dance classes. Adam has since rejoined the police force and lives in a small house with his younger brother.
The next morning, Axel received a phone call from Eddie 'Skate' Hunter, Adam's younger brother. Skate had arrived at home from school and was shocked to find his house in ruin and his older brother missing. Attached to the front door was a picture of Adam chained to a wall at the feet of Mr. X. The criminals began to retake the streets once more. Beatings and lootings took place regularly and in broad daylight. Chaos reigned in the city, far worse than before.
Realizing that "Mr. X" and his syndicate has returned for revenge against him, Blaze, and Adam, Axel wastes no time in telling Blaze about the unexpected situation and Blaze herself is determined to help Axel out in defeating "Mr. X" and rescuing Adam. Accompanied by Adam's young brother Skate and Axel's friend, a professional wrestler named Max Thunder, Axel and Blaze set forth on a rescue mission, which will take them from the city all the way to "Mr. X"'s hideout on a desolate island.</desc>

Dr. Zan discovers what the research is really for and knows the Syndicate must be stopped. He contacts Blaze Fielding with the details of The Syndicate's plan.

    <desc>Set in the future, the game centers around a secret organization of ninja-like operatives known as "Striders", who specializes in various kinds of wetworks such as smuggling, kidnapping, demolitions, and disruption. The player takes control Strider Hiryu, the youngest elite-class Strider in the organization. Hiryu is summoned by the organization's second-in-command, Vice Director Matic, to assassinate his friend Kain, who has been captured by hostile forces and has become a liability to the Striders. Instead of killing him, Hiryu decides to rescue Kain from his captors. With the help of his fellow Strider Sheena, Hiryu uncovers a conspiracy between a certain faction of the Strider organization led by Matic himself and an unknown organization known simply as the "Enterprise" (headed by a man named Faceas Clay) which involves the development of a mind-control weapon codenamed "Zain". In the course of finding and destroying these Zain units, Hiryu learns that the faction of conspirators is headed by Vice Director Matic himself. Hiryu eventually tracks Matic to an orbiting space station where the two Striders face off; after a brief battle Hiryu bests Matic and kills him. Afterwards Hiryu locates and destroys the last of the Zain units.

In the epilogue, it is revealed that though Hiryu was asked to return to the Strider organization he instead opted to retire. The final credits show him sheathing his weapon and walking away.</desc>

    <desc>Strider II, known as Strider Returns: Journey from Darkness in North America, is a sequel to Strider, released for the Sega Mega Drive and Sega Master System in 1992 and the Sega Game Gear in 1994. It should not be confused with the later release of Strider 2 which was developed in-house by Capcom - Strider II was developed by U.S. Gold, who, at the time, had the rights to the Strider license outside of Japan.</desc>

    <desc>Strider has been called into action to save the people of the planet Magenta, armed with a Gyro laser and matter converter. He must fight his way through a forest, a ruined city, underground colonies, a roof-top battle, and finally the prison ship in which the Megantan leader is held.

The gameplay is similar to the original, consisting of running, jumping and attacking, with a very dynamic central character. The laser gun can be used while standing still; moving attacks with the sword are still possible, with the two weapons combining similarly to the Switchblade games. Tokens can be collected, which will turn you into a robot to face the end-of-level enemies if enough are collected.</desc>

A second Striker was released for the Super Nintendo in 1994, being known as World Soccer '94: Road to Glory in North America, World Soccer in Japan and Eric Cantona Football Challenge in France.

After choosing a mission, you can choose which shot type, gun type, and bomb to take with you on the helicopter, and you will then start the mission, A fires (hold for rapidfire). B drops a bomb. C activates the shield.

    <name>Super Baseball 2020 (USA, Europe)</name>
    <desc>Different from real baseball and other baseball video games, this game consists of both male and female characters, as well as robots. All three types of players have the same basic abilities and vary only on their personal strengths. In many cases, human players are better than their robot counterparts. One major difference between the human and robot characters is that the robot characters can blow up (or lose all their power) if they are worked too hard during a game. That can happen if you constantly make them dive for a ball, run extra bases, or even if they get hit by a pitch. Under no stress whatsoever, some robots, especially pitchers, will naturally run out of power as the game progresses. When this happens, they will lose all their abilities and be useless, both offensively and defensively. When that occurs, you can either power them up or replace them with another person on the roster. Human players do not blow up, but human pitchers can tire out. When they are tired, they will pant heavily and throw the ball very slowly. This can be remedied by either an upgrade or, as in real baseball, switching to a relief pitcher.</desc>

    <desc>In the game, each player controls one of the two Bubble Dragons, Bub and Bob. The player can move along platforms, as well as jump from one platform to that above, or to the side, in a similar way to most platform games.
The player can also blow bubbles. These can trap enemies, who are defeated if the bubble is then burst by the player's spiny back. The bubbles also float for a time before bursting, and can be jumped on, allowing access to otherwise inaccessible areas. Players progress to the next level once all enemies on the current level are defeated.
Enemies turn "angry"  becoming pink-colored and moving faster  if they are the last enemy remaining, escape from a bubble after being left too long, or a certain amount of time has been spent on the current level.
After a further time limit expires, an additional invincible enemy appears for each player, actively chasing them using only vertical and horizontal movements. These do not need to be defeated to complete the level, but disappear once a player's life is lost.
Contact with an enemy is deadly, resulting in the loss of a life.</desc>

    <desc>Super Hydlide (originally entitled Hydlide 3: The Space Memories) is the third entry in the Hydlide series, continuing its action RPG legacy. Character creation allows the player to choose one of the four character classes: Warrior, Thief, Priest, and Monk. In combat, the protagonist uses melee or long-ranged weapons or casts magic spells. Unlike the previous games in the series, the player is required to press the attack button during melee combat, instead of simply "bumping" into the enemies. There is an internal clock in the game, which makes it necessary for the protagonist to sleep periodically and regain his strength. The main character also has to eat from time to time, otherwise his hit points will gradually decrease. The morality system from the previous game returns: killing friendly creatures will reduce the player's morality level, which will eventually have an effect on one of the game's most decisive battles.</desc>

    <desc>Super Hydlide (originally entitled Hydlide 3: The Space Memories) is the third entry in the Hydlide series, continuing its action RPG legacy. Character creation allows the player to choose one of the four character classes: Warrior, Thief, Priest, and Monk. In combat, the protagonist uses melee or long-ranged weapons or casts magic spells. Unlike the previous games in the series, the player is required to press the attack button during melee combat, instead of simply "bumping" into the enemies. There is an internal clock in the game, which makes it necessary for the protagonist to sleep periodically and regain his strength. The main character also has to eat from time to time, otherwise his hit points will gradually decrease. The morality system from the previous game returns: killing friendly creatures will reduce the player's morality level, which will eventually have an effect on one of the game's most decisive battles.</desc>

    <name>Super Kick Off (Europe)</name>
    <desc>Super Kick Off is a football game for the Sega Mega Drive, Sega Master System and Sega Game Gear, released exclusively in Europe and Brazil. It is considered by many to be the watered-down version of Kick Off 2, previously released for the Commodore Amiga (and ported to the Amstrad CPC, Atari ST and Commodore 64). Kick Off 2 was originally programmed by Dino Dini for Anco Games, with the console adaptions being handled by Tiertex.

From a franchise perspective, Super Kick Off would be followed by the controversial Kick Off 3: European Challenge. However, Dino Dini, who had no involvement in Kick Off 3 would go on to form his own company and produce the Amiga/IBM PC game Goal!, which shares similar gameplay. Goal! also arrived on the Mega Drive, in the updated form of Dino Dini's Soccer.</desc>

It all depends on how you throw the ball. But don't worry, you'll get your chance at bat. This is a race for the Pennant, so you better hope Tommy's on your side.

Alongside Shadow Dancer, it is the first sequel to Shinobi, and the first game in the Shinobi series released for the Mega Drive. It should also not be confused with the 2002 game with the same name. It was later released on the Mega Drive based arcade platform the Mega-Tech.

The game was also released in several compilations: Mega Games 2 and 6-Pak for the Mega Drive, Sega Classics Arcade Collection for the Sega Mega-CD, Sega Smash Pack for PCs, and Sega Smash Pack for the Sega Dreamcast. It was re-released for the Nintendo Wii's Virtual Console in 2009.</desc>

Various methods such as joypad adapters and link systems are employed to allow multiple players to compete, up to a maximum of 8. The game was critically acclaimed and a best-seller in the UK.

    <name>Super Smash T.V. (USA, Europe)</name>
    <desc>The year is 1999. The world's most popular television show is Smash T.V., an ultra-violent contest between two armed-to-the-teeth combatants, set loose in a series of deadly arenas that are filled to bursting with hordes of mindless beasts and killer robots. The aim of the game is to blast everything in sight and try to grab more cash and prizes than the other guy. Toaster ovens, VCRs, fancy cars and luxury holidays are there for the taking... for anyone who can survive long enough to enjoy them.

Smash T.V. is an insane shoot-em-up from the brain of Eugene Jarvis, creator of Robotron: 2084. It retains that game's frantic style of play and two-joystick control method, but adds plenty of gore, violence, a hint of satire and that all-important two player mode.</desc>

    <desc>As in its predecessor, the player takes control of an helicopter which is used to attack a group of guerrillas. The helicopter itself uses guns and missiles, and can also air brake. A distinctive feature that also appears in the arcade game is the use of different viewpoints during the entire game; during normal gameplay and when fighting sub-bosses, the game utilizes a third-person perspective from behind the helicopter, similar to Space Harrier, but the camera changes to a top-down perspective when fighting bosses. Super Thunder Blade had four stages of play.</desc>

    <desc>As in its predecessor, the player takes control of an helicopter which is used to attack a group of guerrillas. The helicopter itself uses guns and missiles, and can also air brake. A distinctive feature that also appears in the arcade game is the use of different viewpoints during the entire game; during normal gameplay and when fighting sub-bosses, the game utilizes a third-person perspective from behind the helicopter, similar to Space Harrier, but the camera changes to a top-down perspective when fighting bosses. Super Thunder Blade had four stages of play.</desc>

    <desc>Sword of Vermilion is about the son of Erik, king of Excalabria, who takes on a quest of revenge to defeat Tsarkon and free the world of Vermilion from evil.
In the town of Excalabria the people went about their business, and tended to the fields. One day, vicious fighting broke out everywhere as the army from Cartahena, led by the wizard-king Tsarkon, swarmed all over the town. The townsmen were overwhelmed, and the castle of King Erik V collapsed. Erik V summoned his bravest, strongest and most faithful warrior, Blade, and gave him his infant son and an ancient family heirloom, the Ring of Wisdom. Erik ordered Blade to save himself and the child while the castle burned. Blade traveled to a small village named Wyclif, where he settled down and raised the child as his own son. Eighteen years later, the son of Erik begins his quest.
The quest consists of travelling to towns and villages, battling creatures to gain experience and finding items such as swords, shields and armour, as well as many other items such as Herbs and Candles. Boss monsters take the form of larger, stronger creatures which are integral to the story. Fighting Boss Monsters takes place on a side on view of the battle where magic cannot be used.
The titular Sword of Vermilion is the most powerful weapon at the end of the game.</desc>

    <desc>The game puts the player in charge of a self-named corporation in a gritty near-future cyberpunk-style world. Game play involves ordering a four-person team of cyborg agents around cities displayed in a fixed-view isometric style, in pursuit of mission goals such as assassinating executives of a rival syndicate, rescuing captured allies, "persuading" civilians and scientists to join the player's company or simply killing all enemy agents.
As the player progresses through the game, they must manage the research and development of new weaponry and cyborg upgrades. The player has only limited funds, requiring taxation of the conquered territories while ensuring that they are not so over-taxed that they revolt against the player. The player begins the game with simple pistols, progressing through increasingly destructive weaponry that includes Uzis, miniguns, flamethrowers, sniper rifles, time bombs, lasers and the enormously destructive Gauss gun (a rocket launcher). In addition, the player can use items such as medikits to heal his agents, scanners to locate pedestrians/vehicles and the "Persuadertron" to brainwash the player's targets into blind obedience.</desc>

    <desc>Starting at 7.30 in the morning, the player has until 4PM to take a boat on the lake and fish for bass to beat competitors. The boat can be steered freely using a top-down view until an appropriate spot has been found by checking the lowrance monitor. The game then switches to a first-person view, also showing the fisher from a side-view on a separate part of the screen, and it is possible to look around in the environment.

Casting is done using a power meter to determine the distance. As the bait sinks, a monitor can be checked for nearby fish. There are also visual clues through splashing water. The player can check the depth and reel in when needed. When a fish has been caught, it becomes a sensitive play with the line tension to make sure it does not snap shown through the side-view of the fisher. At the end of the day the boat can go back to the weighing area to determine the results. Money earned in the tournaments can be used to acquire new spin reels, bait reels, boats, lines and lures.</desc>

    <name>Tetris (Japan)</name>
    <desc>Tetris is a 1988 Sega System 16 game developed and published by Sega. It was licensed from Atari Games (credited as Tengen) and Mirrorsoft, who held the rights to produce Tetris arcade games at the time. A less powerful version was also released for Sega System E hardware. Both versions are unrelated to Atari's arcade version, released in the same year under the same name.

Sega bizarrely also released versions on Taito's B-System and H-System arcade boards in Japan. The B-System versions were released as upgrade kits for Taito's Nastar and Master of Weapon; the H-System version appears to have been sold on modified boards that previously held Taito's Go for the Gold (released overseas as Recordbreaker) rather than as an upgrade kit.

Sega attempted to port the game to the Sega Mega Drive, however sales were blocked by Nintendo who owned the home console rights to the franchise (they had taken Atari's home console division, Tengen to court over a similar incident on the NES). As such, only about 10 cartridges were produced, all of which were only released in Japan. This version is now a rare collector's item, being sold in auctions for up to US$16000. Because Nintendo had no authority over the arcade versions, the Sega Mega Drive port was brought to Mega-Tech hardware in 1989.</desc>

The first task is to set up your rides within the available land, structuring convenient paths and queues and ideally leaving some space for bigger rides once they become available, and include some lakes and trees to increase the park's allure. Rides range from Teacups and Haunted Houses to the biggest most elaborate roller-coaster you can design, and water rides that loop around other rides.

Shops must also be included, so that the visitors can buy food, drinks and souvenirs - the cunning player will combine salt, sugar and caffeine settings to maximize consumer interest. Staff must be hired to keep everything running smoothly, and they will only work for what they consider a fair rate of pay.</desc>

Buster must go through several levels, including a volcano, an undersea adventure, a pirate ship, and a forest, among many other levels. However, many of his foes are out to stop him, including Roderick Rat and Gene Splicer, who has brainwashed several of Buster's friends, including Plucky Duck, Dizzy Devil and Hamton J Pig. Upon defeating Gene, the helmet used to control Buster's friends will fall off and explode, leaving them slightly confused about what has happened to them, or simply to fall down in a comical fashion, as in the case of Calamity Coyote.

To complete each level, Buster must find Gogo Dodo, who will allow him to jump through a portal. Additionally, Buster can find portals reminiscent of the show's rainbow-coloured logo, that will take Buster into Wackyland. Here, Buster must attempt to collect as many items as he can before touching one of the numerous Dodos that populate the level.</desc>

    <desc>Buster Bunny's mission in this game is to trace down and defeat Montana Max, who has stolen and hidden some treasure as well as rescue Babs Bunny. Buster must go through several levels, including a volcano, an undersea adventure, a pirate ship, and a forest, among many other levels. However, many of his foes are out to stop him, including Roderick Rat and Gene Splicer, who has brainwashed several of Buster's friends, including Plucky Duck, Dizzy Devil and Hamton J Pig. Upon defeating Gene, the helmet used to control Buster's friends will fall off and explode, leaving them slightly confused about what has happened to them, or simply to fall down in a comical fashion, as in the case of Calamity Coyote.

To complete each level, Buster must find Gogo Dodo, who will allow him to jump through a portal. Additionally, Buster can find portals reminiscent of the show's rainbow-coloured logo, that will take Buster into Wackyland. Here, Buster must attempt to collect as many items as he can before touching one of the numerous Dodos that populate the level.</desc>

    <name>ToeJam &amp; Earl (World) (Rev A)</name>
    <desc>ToeJam &amp; Earl has been called a surreal, comic satire, and a "daringly misanthropic commentary on Earthly life". The game's protagonists, ToeJam and Earl, have been described as a "three-legged red alien" and "fat orange alien", respectively. ToeJam wears a large gold medallion and a backwards baseball cap, while Earl is marked by high-tops and oversized sunglasses; both outfits are "over-the-top appropriations" of 1990s urban culture. Their speech features California slang. The game is set to a soundtrack which has been described both as jazz-funk, and as hip hop. For the game's unique sound, composer John Baker was inspired by Herbie Hancock and The Headhunters.

In the game's opening sequence, ToeJam explains that Earl's erratic piloting abilities have resulted in a crash-landing on Earth. He says that they must find the pieces of their spacecraft's wreckage to return to their home planet, Funkotron. The player guides the characters as they avoid Earth's antagonistic inhabitants and search for the debris. Should the player succeed, the final sequence depicts ToeJam and Earl escaping the planet in their reconstructed spacecraft. Under the player's control, the characters proceed across a purple landscape that represents Funkotron, and are greeted by their friends and family.</desc>

    <desc>The plot of the game follows on from that of its predecessor, which followed the adventures of alien protagonists ToeJam and Earl after they crash landed on Earth. After escaping to their home planet of Funkotron, the characters discover that antagonistic Earthlings have stowed-away on the duo's spacecraft.

A sub-plot involves ToeJam and Earl's attempt to lure Lamont the Funkapotamus back from the Funk Dimension, where he is hiding from the invading Earthlings.

ToeJam and Earl must hunt down Earthling antagonists, which include a "pneumatic-drill-crazed construction worker, a camera-wielding tourist, our old friends the bogymen [sic], pea-shooter armed kids and a rather rotund woman with ankle-snapping poodles.

Capturing Earthlings involves rummaging for them in bushes and trees, before pelting the antagonist with "jars" which imprison them. The player completes a level by catching all the at large Earthlings and sending them back to Earth via spacecraft.</desc>

    <desc>Unknown monsters and weird robotic creatures attack the Earth. For some reason, the only ones who can stop the invasion are the three Dinosaurs for Hire: Archie, a tyrannosaurus rex and their leader; the triceratops Lorenzo, lover of fine food, fine wine, and fine clothes, and the one-eyed, unpredictable stegosaurus Reese. Each dino has its own strengths and weaknesses. You guide the dinosaur of your choice through the platform levels of the game. You are equipped with a gun: tons of enemies will attack you from all the sides, so your best bet will be walking with the fire button pressed down. You can shoot to all the directions and also engage in melee combat when the enemy is too close. Each level has a boss enemy waiting for you in the end. There is also a cooperative two-player mode.</desc>

Whether you're infield or outfield, at the plate or on the mound, stealing bases or catching fly-balls, the competition is hot and you're even hotter now that you're playing with a big leaguer like Lasorda. And you've got control. Curve balls, fastballs or sliders are some of the wind-ups you'll pitch to outwit your batter. But be prepared when he connects, you'll have to think fast to make your players perform like a well-oiled machine. Are you up for a single, double, or even triple play? It all depends on how you throw the ball. But don't worry, you'll get your chance at bat. This is a race for the Pennant, so you better hope Tommy's on your side. Now take your pick, choose your line-up and let's play ball!</desc>

    <desc>Your task is to race through 16 countries, each of which features four races, with many real-world circuits recreated in incongruous locations (such as the Monza layout in Ayers Rock, and the old Hockenheim in Vancouver). 

These four-race blocks each represent their own mini-championship, in which you race against 19 cars, needing to finish in the top 10 to continue, and with the top 6 scoring points 10-6-4-3-2-1, and the respective amount of money in thousands. This can be spent on various upgrades, ranging from engine to tires (wet and dry) and from shocks (front, side and rear) to gearboxes. The ideal approach is to buy the more expensive versions ASAP, as you get no saving when upgrading. If you win the four-race championship, you get the next password.</desc>

The Mega Drive port of Populous II was only released in Europe, however plans were made to bring the game to North America as Populous II: Wrath of the Gods, or simply Wrath of the Gods.

The game is split into 10 levels - the first 9 are groups of 3 territories which can be completed in any other, while the final 'Mother of All Battles' has its own surprises. 

Land is mostly of sand, grass or ice. You start with 100 men and you can use whatever quantity you find necessary on each island. The rest men left will go to another level with another new 100. In the second half of the game you can freeze men to save them for the Mother of All Battles. Once you select your island and place for your HQ, you must do some research for better weapons and defences. On the roof of your buildings you can put protectors like archers, gunmen, boiling oil men, and later on even laser turrets. If you send a team of unarmed men into an unoccupied square, they will build an additional base there, with larger armies completing this more quickly.</desc>

    <desc>Uchuu Senkan Gomora (), is a shoot-em-up by UPL, originally released in 1990 for the arcade, and then ported to the Sega Mega Drive in 1991. While the arcade version was released overseas (in the US under license from American Sammy under the name Bio-Ship Paladin), the MD version was only released in Japan  however an American title screen is present in the ROM and displayable if the region is set to US, which may mean a US release was planned (this is unconfirmed). It is UPL's only Mega Drive game  they would go bankrupt shortly after publishing it (the later Task Force Harrier EX was ported and published by Treco).

A shoots your weapons; the laser weapon from your main ship can be charged by holding A. B allows you to take control of a beam shot. While B is held down, the D-pad will move a box-shaped target on the screen and A will shoot beam shots toward the target. C is listed as "PAD MODE" but does not appear to do anything. In each level, you can get orbs which give you either subships that shoot weapons diagonally or certain powerups (such as an automatically moving beam target or doubling the size of your ship).

Pressing Start at the title screen gives you a configuration menu where you can, among other things, choose to play one of two 2-player modes. Normal 2-player mode is 2-player cooperative (two ships on screen at once), while another option allows the second player to take control of the beam laser while you take control of the main ship.</desc>

    <desc>In this hectic, top-down, vertically-scrolling shooter where the screen is constantly filled with enemies and bullets, players have a constant, unlimited firing rate, enhanced by power-ups that include missiles, target-seeking bullets, shields, additional speed, extra power and bonus points. In Grind Stormer the ship always moves at a fast speed and the player can collect bombs that damage the entire screen and fend off bullets. The other variant V Five takes a Gradius-approach to power-ups, having the player advance through a selection of power-ups shown on the right by collecting tokens. In the first mode power-ups are immediately applied. In the second mode the ship is much slower and the player needs to decide to spend tokens on speed power-ups right away or save them to advance to seeking bullets or additional power.</desc>

The inhabitants sensed that a war would unfold sooner or later and countries formed several alliances, who in turned harbored feelings of distrust against each other. on June 1914 at Sarajevo, the Crown Prince of Austria was assasinated and resulted in a chain reaction of violence across the entire continent. It was said that a strange beautiful woman was involved within the shadows.

It was Elizabeth Bartley who had plotted together with the dark sorceress Drolta Tzuentes to unleash an international global war and use the souls of the dead to revive their Lord, Dracula.

Two man, descendants of the legendary Belmont family of vampire hunters, named John Morris and Eric Lecarde arose to counter the threat.

Together they travled to the ruins of Dracula's castle were unable to find any trace of the Vampire Lord. After learning that Elizabeth was nearby, they followed in hot pursuit while fighting their way all across Europe. With much effort, John and Eric were able to finally end the menace of Dracula and Elizabeth after a final showdown in Castle Proserpina.

Victory would soon be tainted when learned of the terrible price that came with using the whip's full power.</desc>

In the town of Excalabria the people went about their business, and tended to the fields. One day, vicious fighting broke out everywhere as the army from Cartahena, led by the wizard-king Tsarkon, swarmed all over the town. The townsmen were overwhelmed, and the castle of King Erik V collapsed. Erik V summoned his bravest, strongest and most faithful warrior, Blade, and gave him his infant son and an ancient family heirloom, the Ring of Wisdom. Erik ordered Blade to save himself and the child while the castle burned. Blade traveled to a small village named Wyclif, where he settled down and raised the child as his own son. Eighteen years later, the son of Erik begins his quest.
The quest consists of travelling to towns and villages, battling creatures to gain experience and finding items such as swords, shields and armour, as well as many other items such as Herbs and Candles. Boss monsters take the form of larger, stronger creatures which are integral to the story. Fighting Boss Monsters takes place on a side on view of the battle where magic cannot be used.

    <desc>Verytex () is a 1991 shoot-'em-up game by Asmik for the Sega Mega Drive released exclusively in Japan.

Humans have developed the ability to colonize other planets and have started doing so with great success as no extraterrestrial life has been found. One day, however, the armed forces of the prosperous planet Syracuse have turned on its people for no apparent reason, and it is up to you and the Verytex fighter to stop them and find out why.

A shoots (you have rapidfire). B drops bombs (you have a limited supply, but you can get up to 6 by collecting items with the letter B on them). C changes the speed of the ship (there are three available speeds, the current speed is shown in the HUD), and the charge generated at the back of your ship can be used to destroy close-by enemies.

Powerups are collected as usual. There are three weapons available (each identified by a different color): the default "yellow" weapon that shoots normal bullets, the "blue" weapon that shoots boomerang-shaped bullets which are weak but very spread, and the "red" weapon that shoots a very powerful concentrated laser but only can shoot forwards. Collecting the same kind of weapon the ship currently has will level up it.

Two more power-ups are available: one with the letter "M" that makes the ship shoot missiles alongside the current weapon (up to 7 at any given time on screen) and one with the letter "S" with gives the player a shield that can last several hits.</desc>

    <desc>Virtua Racing is a home port of Sega's first ever 3D, polygon-based racing game for the arcade. The game consists of racing Formula-1-looking cars around a beginner, intermediate, or expert track, competing against a second player or computer drivers. Despite having Formula-1 cars, the game controls are very "arcadey" and players can see the leap they made from here to Daytona.

The Megadrive/Genesis version of Virtua Racing is of note as it is the only game for the system which features the SVP chip (Sega Virtua Processor). The chip is a 3D processor built into each cartridge (the console itself had no 3D capability) and is very similar to the SNES's SuperFX chips, used in games such as Starfox and Stunt Race FX.</desc>

The game consists of three side-scrolling platform stages and three stages that take place from a rear view. Bart assumes the roles of a pig, dinosaur, and baby for the platform stages. He tosses tomatoes and eggs, slides down a water slide, and drives a motorcycle in a post-apocalyptic Springfield for the three remaining stages.

In this game, player-controlled wrestlers attempt to pin the opponents to the mat by reducing their power meter until they can fight no more. There is a large number of moves to perform, including turnbuckle maneuvers and "illegal" acts such as hitting the opponent with a metal folding chair.

This game supports up to four simultaneous players, and has the following modes: One-on-One, Tag Team, Bedlam, Survivor Series, Royal Rumble, Raw Endurance Match, and Rematch.</desc>

    <desc>WWF Super WrestleMania is a wrestling game that uses rules and wrestlers from the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). The game introduces a characteristic "tug of war" gameplay style, which involves two wrestlers grappling each other until one of them has the upper hand. The player has to repeatedly tap a button to execute this move. All the wrestlers share the same set of typical WWF moves such as scoop slams, suplexes, hip tosses, dropkicks, clotheslines, and elbow drops. The Genesis (MegaDrive) version adds signature moves unique to each characters.</desc>

    <desc>WrestleMania's one-player mode has the player choose one of eight wrestlers - Bam Bam Bigelow, Bret Hart, Doink the Clown, Lex Luger, Razor Ramon, Shawn Michaels, The Undertaker or Yokozuna. One unique feature is that each character can "bleed" his respective objects other than blood upon taking damage from most attacks in the Mortal Kombat sense. Such "bleeding" objects include Yokozuna's food and Bam Bam Bigelow's flames.
WWF WrestleMania features two single-player modes: the Intercontinental Championship and the WWF Championship. In the Intercontinental Championship mode, the player must win four one-on-one matches, two two-on-one matches, and one three-on-one match to win the title. In the more difficult WWF Championship mode, the player must win four two-on-one matches, two three-on-one matches, and finally a "WrestleMania Challenge," where the player must defeat every wrestler in the game in a gauntlet, starting with a three-on-one setup, with each eliminated opponent being replaced with another until all eight have been defeated.
The game also features two multi-player modes; head to head, a one-on-one match between two players, or cooperative, where the two players team up in a tag team version of the WrestleMania Challenge in which they must defeat the game's eight wrestlers in groups of two to become the Tag Team Champions.</desc>

You take on the role of Dastardly and Mutley from the Hanna-Barbera cartoon series in this action title with superficial racing overtones. Your aim is to complete each course in a particular position, which is achieved either by waiting for them to suffer enough damage to drop out of the race, or by inflicting that damage yourself. Your car is armed with a forward-shooting arrow to impale the opposition cars, and deal with the many hazards the races throw at you, including boulders and rabbits, which can be taken out for points.

    <name>Wayne Gretzky and the NHLPA All-Stars (USA, Europe)</name>
    <desc>One of the many hockey games released, this version not only let the player control Gretzky, but other major players of the time as well such as Mario Lemieux, Eric Lindros, Mark Messier among many others, 600 total. It also features the 26 NHL teams at the time as well as 6 International teams to choose from.

The gameplay is similar to many other hockey games with the standard modes such as Exhibition, Season, Playoffs or even a "Just Play" option that instantly took the player to a random game. There is also a "Simulation Mode" that gives the game an authentic feel complete with penalties or an "Arcade Mode" that was more action oriented and with less rules. A battery back-up keeps extensive track of stats and has a two-player option as well.</desc>

The game features a basic 3D engine which allows to simulate slopes with ease, which enhances the gameplay of some events such as the Downhill. Gameplay, as expected from a Winter sports game, relies on finding the faster trajectories in most events (Downhill, Giant Slalom, Luge and Bobsled), pacing the run correctly (Cross Country and Biathlon), skill and timing (Ski Jump), with button mashing reserved for just one (speed skating). The player (up to ten) can select his (or her) competitor face and nationality from one of 16 possible choices, and by selecting different difficulty settings, different computer controlled athletes take part in the competition along the player.</desc>

The game is an action platformer divided into several stages. In each one of them, either Wiz or Liz must collect wabbits before time runs out. The player must pick up floating letters that appear when a wabbit is collected, and use them to spell out a magic word shown at the top of the screen. Once the word has been spelled, the newly found wabbits leave fruit, stars, and clocks that increase the time limit. The time limit can also be extended by picking up a glowing orange orb which appears during the last ten seconds of the counter, adding thirty seconds to it.</desc>

Your old mentor Mordamir has disappeared. Probably kidnapped. You're not too sure where he might be, but a dungeon is always a good place to look, so you seek out the nearest one and plunge into its depths. Beware: 8 levels of isometric death await.

The Immortal is the prototype of a trial-and-error game. Progress is made by encountering a hazard, dying, solving the problem, encountering the next hazard. To solve a level, you have to know its traps and their patterns by heart. As frustrating as this may sound (it is), The Immortal quite cleverly balances annoyance with curiosity and graphical rewards.</desc>

    <name>Wolfchild (USA)</name>
    <desc>Dr. Kal Morrow, expert in genetic research and creation of human-animal hybrids, has been kidnapped and his family brutally murdered by the terrorist organization CHIMERA. His surviving son Saul takes it upon himself to avenge his family. Using his father's research, he turns into a man-wolf and sets out to find CHIMERA's base and defeat their leader Karl Draxx.

As Saul, it is your job to traverse five different areas on your way to Draxx. When Saul collects enough power-ups, he turns into his wolf form and gains a special psychic shot attack, which can be improved by collecting futher power-ups. However, if Saul loses health, he turns back into his human form and only has his fists to fight the numerous enemies.</desc>

    <name>Wolverine - Adamantium Rage (USA, Europe)</name>
    <desc>Wolverine: Adamantium Rage is a side-scrolling platform beat-em-up. Wolverine, aka Logan, searches desperately for clues about his past and his identify. Using the computers of the X-Men mansion, Wolverine soon receives coordinates to somewhere in Canada and is told to come alone. As the missions and levels progress he finds clues which lead him inevitably on to the next level.

The main character has a very large selection of combat moves, and also has great agility and the ability to climb walls using his wrist-spikes. Bonus pickups are provided in the level maps. Many of them are hidden very thoroughly which invites the player to use Wolverine's agility and climbing abilities to explore every corner. The levels include a secret lab, a ninja training camp, a hallucinogenic world, and others.</desc>

    <name>Wonder Boy III - Monster Lair (Japan, Europe)</name>
    <desc>Released in Japan and Europe for the Mega Drive. 

Wonder Boy III: Monster Lair is a quite different game to most of the games in the Wonder Boy series. You play a green-haired dude who must attack the invaders that attempt to collect weapons and use them to destroy the land. The game starts out like a simple platform game, but it's just when Wonder Boy enters the skull further on that the game is transformed into a shoot 'em up, so basically the gameplay consists of action and shooter scenes.</desc>

    <desc>Wonder Library is a very rare Sega Mega Drive cartridge which shipped with some variants of the Japanese Wondermega. When hooked up to a Mega Drive connected to the Sega Mega-CD (or a Wondermega), a specific but presently unknown (possibly Sony-made, JVC-made, or Aplix-made) type of book-on-CD can be played. As with other Wondermega-related products, the cartridge features Wonder Dog heavily. It is unknown whether or not any emulator can use a cart-boot feature to run this game (some do support Flux, which works similarly, so it is possible).</desc>

    <name>World of Illusion - Fushigi na Magic Box (Japan) (Beta)</name>
    <desc>Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck are sucked into a magical world, while preparing for a magic act. Now they must survive over a dozen different side-scrolling levels, in order to return home.

Mickey and Donald can run, jump, or attack by flourishing their capes. Enemies defeated in this way turn into doves, cards, or other harmless objects depending on the enemy. After defeating the boss of each level, a new magic spell is learned, allowing the pair to traverse the next level; i.e. flying on a magic carpet or going underwater in an air bubble. This was one of the few Genesis games to feature voice samples.
The gameplay changes depending on if the player selects Mickey or Donald, in a one player mode, or if two people want to control both characters at once. For instance, Mickey can squeeze through certain gaps, while Donald must find a different route; if both are playing, Mickey can pull Donald through the gap. Either can stand on the others' shoulders to ascend higher, and lower a rope to pull the other up.</desc>

    <name>World of Illusion - Fushigi na Magic Box (Japan)</name>
    <desc>Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck are sucked into a magical world, while preparing for a magic act. Now they must survive over a dozen different side-scrolling levels, in order to return home.

Mickey and Donald can run, jump, or attack by flourishing their capes. Enemies defeated in this way turn into doves, cards, or other harmless objects depending on the enemy. After defeating the boss of each level, a new magic spell is learned, allowing the pair to traverse the next level; i.e. flying on a magic carpet or going underwater in an air bubble. This was one of the few Genesis games to feature voice samples.
The gameplay changes depending on if the player selects Mickey or Donald, in a one player mode, or if two people want to control both characters at once. For instance, Mickey can squeeze through certain gaps, while Donald must find a different route; if both are playing, Mickey can pull Donald through the gap. Either can stand on the others' shoulders to ascend higher, and lower a rope to pull the other up.</desc>

    <desc>Worms () is a critically acclaimed turn based strategy game designed for the Commodore Amiga and ported to a variety of platforms including the Sega Mega Drive and Sega Saturn. It was the first in the series of Worms games, which continue to this day and still largely share the same gameplay as the original.

The game involves the player controlling a team of worms, each supplied with a variety of different weapons, and the aim is to eliminate all the enemy worms. Worms was revolutionary at the time due to the randomly generated and fully destructaile landscapes that the game employs, so an explosion will leave a huge crater and a different strategy may need to be divised.

As it is turn-based, the game allows up to 16 players to take control of units (though there is only ever a maximum of four teams).</desc>

Each group of enemies you destroy grants you a cash reward and every once in a while you enter Colin's Bargain Basement, where you can use this cash to purchase upgrades for your ship like better weapons, speed &amp; health upgrades etc. Some upgrades can also be picked up during the levels.

The first part of the game has an organic feel to it, while the second part of the game features mechanical enemies. As there are some maze-like sections with dead-ends in the game, your spaceship scrolls backwards when you keep pressing the down key.</desc>

    <desc>Zero Wing is an horizontal shooter game where the player is in control of a ZIG, an escape pod released after its main ship was attacked and destroyed by the evil cyborg CATS, bent on taking over the world.

Like most games in the genre, there are three color-coded weapons: red (scatter), green (homing) and blue (lasers). Each weapon has three levels of power, and to obtain those, similar upgrades must be collected sequentially. However, what makes the game unique is the ability to use a traction beam to trap an enemy and then throw him against his peers, destroying them.

The game (more precisely, the European PAL version of it) is known for being the origin of the grammatically incorrect phrase in the English translation, All your base are belong to us, which has since become an internet phenomenon.</desc>

    <desc>The desert screamed as the nuclear blast ripped into its belly like a jagged knife. And there, deep within its seething entrails, Evil was born. Swelling against its blistered skin, the Evil began a search for primal vengeance, exploding from the sand in anger and pain.

Beneath the blood red sky the peaceful town of Lovelock slept, secure in its ignorance.</desc>

    <desc>This world was once a civilization brought together by magic and technology. As civilization advanced, those who possessed the power of technology and magic segregated due to their differences in ideas, and formed two separate societies of humans and demons.

The human race continued to develop their civilization with technology, while the demons started to construct their own society with magic. This balance did not hold for very long, however, and technology was gradually replacing magic.

Soon afterwards, an ultimate weapon from technological civilization appeared, and in an ironic twist of fate, lost control and destroyed the whole world, along with all civilization therein.

Nearly a thousand years have gone by without incident, until one day the ancient technology lying deep within the earth was excavated. Mankind was once again on its way to committing the same mistakes of the past...

The world now is divided into four kingdoms, each representing one of the four natural forces and with four temples: 
- The Cruz Kingdom governs the water with the Moon Temple. 
- The bold Galien Kingdom emerges as a tropical desert climate near the Sun Temple. 
- In the polar regions is the Zak Empire that expert in technical research, with the power of the Star Temple. 
- The Lear Kingdom lies among a picturesque scenery protected by the Wind Temple. 

The world was at peace, when suddenly demons from legend appeared throughout the land. Humanity panicked and was at a loss. What have the demons come for? What secret do the temples hold? Just who is behind all of this? Who will see through this shrouded mystery?</desc>
