    <desc>In the year 2026, a corrupt government has used a television broadcasting company called Astralnet Broadcasting Company to secretly control the population and keep them brainwashed. During these times a group of pro-democratic rebels, led by Guy Freelander, has obtained a secret taped meeting between top government officials and ABC directors discussing their diabolical plans. Convinced that if they play the tape through ABC's broadcasting, they can convince the repressed population to rise up against the current regime. The only problem that stands in their way is the way to the broadcasting center, a death trap nicknamed the maze.

The player takes control of Guy Freelander and must transverse this maze, with 20 levels and 100 different rooms in total, using a standard gun and a knife to take out security guards, androids, mutants and must avoid various pitfalls and traps scattered in these rooms. The view of the game is isometric and has a password feature to allow players to pick up and return to the previous room they were in without having to replay the previous levels. There are no life bars, instead the player can take four hits before their character dies with five lives. After losing these five lives, the game will be over.</desc>

    <name>Arliel - Crystal Densetsu (Japan)</name>
    <desc>The continent of Tyramus has lived in peace for almost a century, thanks to the four elemental crystals of the kingdom of Arliel. However, peace is threatened by the invading armies of the Jyn Empire, led by Emperor Grym, who wants to use the four crystals to rule over Tyramus. Fortunately, Princess Iris can escape with one of the crystals and now the player has to protect her and the crystal and somehow find a way to drive back the hordes of Jyn.

Gameplay in Crystal Warriors is quite similar to Shining Force. The player fights in turn-based battles controlling different characters like fighters, healers, rangers and mages, all with different strengths and skills. Whenever two units engage in battle, they enter a duel mode lasting for up to two turns. In this mode the player can choose between four commands: "battle" (attack), "retreat", "spell" and "monster". While the first three commands are quite self-explanatory, the "monster" command is interesting. Whenever a non-human enemy is defeated, it can be tamed and be used in battles. While most monsters do not have many HP they can serve as good attackers for physically weak characters or take some hits in order to protect his master. In-between battles the player can visit towns to rest, buy weapons and spells or recruit new party members.</desc>

Also unlike the previous game, Super Monaco GP II was not released in arcades or for any non-Sega console or computer.

At the time of release it was regarded as the most realistic racing experience on home video game consoles, and the fact that it was endorsed by Ayrton Senna meant the game was very popular. However, due to these celebrity endorsements, it is unlikely Super Monaco GP II will be re-released without cutbacks.</desc>

Also unlike the previous game, Super Monaco GP II was not released in arcades or for any non-Sega console or computer.

At the time of release it was regarded as the most realistic racing experience on home video game consoles, and the fact that it was endorsed by Ayrton Senna meant the game was very popular. However, due to these celebrity endorsements, it is unlikely Super Monaco GP II will be re-released without cutbacks.</desc>

    <name>Crystal Warriors (USA, Europe)</name>
    <desc>The continent of Tyramus has lived in peace for almost a century, thanks to the four elemental crystals of the kingdom of Arliel. However, peace is threatened by the invading armies of the Jyn Empire, led by Emperor Grym, who wants to use the four crystals to rule over Tyramus. Fortunately, Princess Iris can escape with one of the crystals and now the player has to protect her and the crystal and somehow find a way to drive back the hordes of Jyn.

Gameplay in Crystal Warriors is quite similar to Shining Force. The player fights in turn-based battles controlling different characters like fighters, healers, rangers and mages, all with different strengths and skills. Whenever two units engage in battle, they enter a duel mode lasting for up to two turns. In this mode the player can choose between four commands: "battle" (attack), "retreat", "spell" and "monster". While the first three commands are quite self-explanatory, the "monster" command is interesting. Whenever a non-human enemy is defeated, it can be tamed and be used in battles. While most monsters do not have many HP they can serve as good attackers for physically weak characters or take some hits in order to protect his master. In-between battles the player can visit towns to rest, buy weapons and spells or recruit new party members.</desc>

    <desc>A prince and princess were in love with each other until a jealous demon turned the happy couple into a set of stone paddles; resembling that of the pinball kind.Suddenly, a ball came into existence that could use the prince and princess in order to defeat the demons that now rule over the kingdom. Players have to use two paddles; the upper one is used to defeat demons while the lower one helps to prevent the player from dropping to its demise at the bottom of the board. By defeating bad guys and smashing through breakable blocks, the player advances towards the boss of each level.
Resembling a harder version of Arkanoid, the vertically scrolling screen forces the ball to move constantly forward in an attempt to reach the boss.

    <desc>A prince and princess were in love with each other until a jealous demon turned the happy couple into a set of stone paddles; resembling that of the pinball kind.Suddenly, a ball came into existence that could use the prince and princess in order to defeat the demons that now rule over the kingdom. Players have to use two paddles; the upper one is used to defeat demons while the lower one helps to prevent the player from dropping to its demise at the bottom of the board. By defeating bad guys and smashing through breakable blocks, the player advances towards the boss of each level.
Resembling a harder version of Arkanoid, the vertically scrolling screen forces the ball to move constantly forward in an attempt to reach the boss.

    <name>Jurassic Park (Japan)</name>
    <desc>One of many games based on the 1993 blockbuster Jurassic Park, the version for Sega's 8-bit systems combines side-scrolling shooting action and platforming levels.

In each of the five stages of the game, one escaped dinosaur species must be recaptured. Each level begins with a side-scrolling driving section. Dinosaurs attack the car and must be fend off by firing at them with a crosshair. If the player survives long enough, a boss battle against an especially powerful dinosaur follows.

After the completion of the driving section the level continues with a platform section. The player must jump, duck and climb to survive moving lifts, floors that will crumble under his feet, environmental hazards like acid drops, steam leaks or giant boulders and more. Dinosaurs will of course also stand in the way, but can be defeated by using several weapons: a rifle, a grenade launcher and hand grenades. Navigating the often maze-like levels will lead to the dinosaur that must be captured and a corresponding boss fight.

The first four levels (featuring a Velociraptor, Pteranodon, Triceratops and Brachiosaurus) can be tackled in any order, but the final level, featuring the Tyrannosaurus Rex, is only unlocked when the others have been completed.</desc>

Last Action Hero delivers all the excitement of the Schwarzenegger film with just one difference... you're the star!

    <desc>This is a side-story, set in the same world as the famous Lunar RPGs: Silver Star and Eternal Blue. The town of Burg is populated by harvesters, and you take control of two girls, Ellie and Lena. One day, they are sent to the island of Ien where they should study magic, and there begins their adventure.

The game is a traditional Japanese-style RPG. You navigate your party through a top-down world, visiting towns and hostile areas. Enemy encounters are random, the battles are turn-based and are viewed from first-person perspective.

Whilst not officially released in English, there is now a completed fan-translation of this game.</desc>

    <desc>Mortal Kombat is a side-scrolling 1 on 1 fighting game. Fighting is set as one on one kombat, allowing each player to perform a variety of punches, kicks, and special moves in order to defeat their opponent. When the opponent faces their second round loss, the winner can perform a finishing move called a "Fatality" on the loser. The Fatality is a move unique to each fighter that graphically kills the loser in a blood-soaked finale.</desc>

    <desc>NBA Jam, which featured 2-on-2 basketball, was one of the first real playable basketball arcade games, and was also one of the first sports games to feature NBA-licensed teams and players, and their real digitized likenesses. A key feature of NBA Jam was the exaggerated nature of the play - players jumped many times above their own height, making slam dunks that defied both human capabilities and the laws of physics. There were no fouls, free throws, or violations except goaltending and 24 second violations. This meant the player was able to freely shove or elbow his opponent out of the way. Additionally, the game had an "on fire" feature, where if one player made three baskets in a row, he would become "on fire" and have unlimited turbo, no goaltending, and increased shooting ability, until the other team scored (or the player had scored four consecutive baskets while "on fire").</desc>

    <desc>Ninja Gaiden begins with a cinematic animation in which 2 ninjas duel to the death; one goes down. It is revealed that the doomed ninja is the father of Ryu Hayabusa. When Ryu learns of this, he embarks on a quest to find out who killed his father and why. This quest takes him to America to find an archaeologist with whom Ryu's father was working. From there, Ryu becomes embroiled in an evil, supernatural conspiracy involving a villain named Jaquio who has plans to use an ancient castle and some relics to unleash a terrifying evil upon the world.

Ninja Gaiden is a side scrolling game where Ryu the ninja can run, jump, and slash with his ninja sword. He can also attach to any vertical surface. Powerups are littered throughout the landscape that allow Ryu to toss fireballs and ninja stars, and perform other feats.

Ryu will battle through urban city settings, forests, jungles, snow covered castles, underground railroads, and ancient castles. A major feature in Ninja Gaiden are the cinematic scenes -- sometimes fullscreen -- through which the storyline unfolds.</desc>

Game description:

 "All is not well for Bruno, the baby Ottifant. A father captured by Aliens! Or so our Otti-infant imagines as he follows the trail of sweets that will lead him to his abducted parent. It's a trail of peril and adventure--- terrifying toys, a blood-chilling basement and an office of hi-tech horror."</desc>

    <desc>Ristar, known as Ristar the Shooting Star ( Risut za Shtingu Sut?) in Japan, is a platform video game released by Sega in 1995 for the Sega Game Gear. While sharing themes and gameplay elements from its main counterpart, Ristar, for the Sega Genesis, it is a largely different game. The game was well received by critics, who felt the gameplay mechanics were transferred over well to the older, aging Game Gear system, but were divided on whether or not the game was worth playing if both versions of the game were available to the consumer. The game received even less exposure than its Genesis counterpart, due to the Game Gear being towards the end of its lifecycle, and having less of a userbase to begin with in comparison to the Genesis.</desc>

    <name>Road Rash (Europe)</name>
    <desc>Road Rash is the name of a motorcycle-racing video game series by Electronic Arts in which the player participates in violent, illegal street races. The series started on the Mega Drive and made its way to various other systems over the years. The game's title is based on the slang term for the severe friction burns that can occur in a motorcycle fall where skin comes into contact with the ground at high speed.

In an attempt to improve on the basic Hang-On concept, where the player's vehicle remains on the same horizontal plane and turns are essentially a matter of moving left or right, Road Rash requires that players contend with various grade changes. The physics reflect the act of going up or down a hill, as well as turning while climbing; this results in the ability to launch one's motorcycle great distances, resulting in crashes (and their animations). Aside from this, Road Rash has a standard system of obstacles including street signs, trees, poles, and livestock; and taking from OutRun, active traffic while racing against other bikers.

What Road Rash really brings to the table is "brawling"; the player can fight other bikers with a variety of hand weapons or simple punches and kicks. The player initially starts off with just those basics, but can grab a weapon from another rider by timing a punch correctly. The list of weapons has grown with the games, starting from the clubs in the first Road Rash, and eventually including things like crowbars, nunchaku, and cattle prods. Whatever the weapon, successful attacks damage an opponent's stamina, and depleting this stamina will cause a biker to wipeout which can also damage the bike; this functions much like hitting a car or other major obstacle, and it all applies to you as much as to other racers (though in most of the games, you have more stamina than opponents).

As mentioned before, the last and most major obstacle are cops. The motorcycle police officers fight the player as another opponent and serve as gameplay enforcers by culling players who fall too far behind or choose to explore the world rather than race in it. Losing a fight with an officer or being caught by one while off one's motorcycle causes the player to be Busted, ending the race.</desc>

    <desc>The storyline to Sonic Chaos, like most Sonic stories, revolves around Dr. Robotnik and his quest for world domination via the mythical Chaos Emeralds. The Emeralds are the source of vitality for all living things, but they could be turned into nuclear bombs and laser weapons in the hands of the rotten Dr. Robotnik.

Dr. Robotnik has stolen the Red Chaos Emerald, causing the other five to "lose balance" and scatter themselves into a parallel universe. As a result of the instability, South Island is now sinking into the ocean. It is up to Sonic and Tails to find the Chaos Emeralds and restore harmony to the universe, or else the innocent residents of South Island will find themselves taking a long swim.</desc>

    <desc>Star Wars: Super Return of the Jedi offers a good variety of action for a Game Gear game, with power-ups and continue points located throughout the game. Choosing from five playable characters and two vehicles keeps the game fresh, while simple controls (one for attacking, the other for jumping) make it a game anyone can get into.

The graphics look very good for the Game Gear, with solid representations of our favorite characters from the Star Wars saga. Luke looks especially nice, complete with glowing lightsaber. Though the sound is not great, it gets the job done. Unfortunately, the fantastic Star Wars theme music just doesn't sound great.

The ability to choose your characters greatly enhances the replay value, and the levels are long enough to keep most gamers busy for quite some time. Some are very difficult and require a lot of patience while performing precise jumping.</desc>

    <desc>The game has an unusual naming scheme. In Japan there were no issues, as the game was published by SIMS themselves. In North America and PAL regions however, publishing rights were given to Tengen, who altered many of the in-game banners and renamed the game Tengen World Cup Soccer, even though the majority of the work was done by SIMS.

The game offers 24 different national teams from across the world, although the choices aren't based on any official tournament from the era. For 1993 the list is quite out of date; the Federal Republic of Germany (more commonly known as West Germany) had not existed since 1990 after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Russia is represented with the flag of the Soviet Union which dissolved in late 1991, and Yugoslavia had ceased to exist by mid-1992.</desc>

Don't miss, 'cause you'll lose a customer for every bad throw. Now, for the real fun: score even bigger points by bombarding nonsubscribers' homes, taking out their windows, lamps and statues! But watch out for bad drivers, skateboarders, remote control cars and lots of other obstacles. They can ruin your day real fast. After work, take on the Training Course, a BMX-style bonus round that'll test your aim and riding skills to the max!</desc>
