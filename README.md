# recalbox-gamelists
Emulationstation gamelists and images for recalbox.

This repository regroups gamelists and images for emulationstation systems in recalbox.

Rom names are based on "NO-INTRO" sets, that are very clean sets for many systems.

From the website of no-intro : 
>What "No-Intro" does is fill some .dat files, to be used with ROM-Managers, with information about the known ROMS released. Often there are more versions of the same ROM dump, but most of them are garbage, some examples may include: bad dumps, hacks, fakes, overdumps, underdumps, and so on. "No-Intro" lists only the best available ROM; it must be a full dump with no faults and no changes to the file, basically just the ROMS that are the closest as possible to the original licensed cartridges. 


See http://www.no-intro.org/ for more informations on their game database.
